SOFTWARE RIGHTS\par
\par
ANTLR 1989-2005 Developed by Terence Parr\par
Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com\par
\par
We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the\par
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever\par
they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the\par
code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of\par
ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.\par
\par
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,\par
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing\par
ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or\par
incorporate any source code into one of your programs\par
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that\par
you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,\par
research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have\par
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that\par
you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the\par
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these\par
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this\par
system and expect to make other tools available as they are\par
completed.\par

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</li>\par

\par
<li><strong>Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>.

All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>\par
\par
<p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong>The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: </p>\par
\par
\par
<ol type="a">\par
<li>\par
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.\par
</li>\par
\par
\par
<li>\par
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\par
</li>\par
\par
</ol>\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
<p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>\par
\par
<p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\par
\par
\par
<p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>\par
\par
<p><strong>7. Termination</strong> </p>\par
\par
<ol type="a">\par
\par
<li>\par
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\par
</li>\par
</ol>\par
\par
<p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong> </p>\par
\par
<ol type="a">\par
\par
<li>\par
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\par
\par

\par
<li>\par
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\par

\par
      Copyright (c) 2005 Bob Ippolito.  All rights reserved.\par
\par
      This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:\par
\par
      Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1\par
\par
      1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:\par
\par
      a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;\par
\par
      b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;\par
\par
      c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;\par
\par
      d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\par
\par
      e) to display the Original Work publicly.\par
\par
      2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.\par
\par
      3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\par
\par
      4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\par
\par
      5) This section intentionally omitted.\par
\par
      6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\par
\par
      7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\par
\par
      8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\par
\par
      9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\par
\par
      10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\par
\par
      11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.  101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\par
\par
      12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\par
\par
      13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\par
\par
      14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\par
\par
      15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\par

\par
      <ol type="a">\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"Collective Work"</strong> means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"Derivative Work"</strong> means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"Original Author"</strong> means the individual or entity who created the Work.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"Work"</strong> means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\par
\par
      </li>\par
      </ol>\par
\par
      <p><strong>2. Fair Use Rights.</strong> Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. </p>\par
\par
\par
      <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: </p>\par

\par
      <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong>The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: </p>\par
\par
\par
      <ol type="a">\par
      <li>\par
      You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.\par
      </li>\par
\par
\par
      <li>\par
      If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\par

      <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>\par
\par
      <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\par
\par
\par
      <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>\par
\par
      <p><strong>7. Termination</strong> </p>\par
\par
      <ol type="a">\par
\par
      <li>\par
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\par
      </li>\par
      </ol>\par
\par
      <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong> </p>\par
\par
      <ol type="a">\par
\par
      <li>\par
      Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\par
\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\par

ANTLR 1989-2006 Developed by Terence Parr\par
Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com\par
\par
We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the\par
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever\par
they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the\par
code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of\par
ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.\par
\par
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,\par
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing\par
ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or\par
incorporate any source code into one of your programs\par
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that\par
you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,\par
research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have\par
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that\par
you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the\par
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these\par
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this\par
system and expect to make other tools available as they are\par
completed.\par

\par
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,\par
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing\par
ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or\par
incorporate any source code into one of your programs\par
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that\par
you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,\par
research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have\par
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that\par
you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the\par
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these\par
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this\par
system and expect to make other tools available as they are\par
completed.\par

LEGAL NOTICES\par
======================================================================\par
\par
Roo is copyright (C) 2008-2010 SpringSource Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par
\par
Roo is licensed under the GPLv3: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\par
\par
The contents of roo-annotations-*.jar are dual licensed under both the\par
GPLv3 and also the Apache License, Version 2.0: \par
\par
     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html. \par
\par
You may apply your choice of GPLv3 or ASLv2 to your use of the\par
roo-annotations-*.jar file.\par
\par
Ensuring an ASLv2 license is provided for the roo-annotations-*.jar\par
file is SpringSource's reassurance that we do not intend for GPLv3\par
obligations to extend to people simply using Roo to build software.\par
\par
In connection with the annotations, we further note:\par
\par
 1. The annotations are source level retention only. As such there is\par
    no requirement for the roo-annotations-*.jar file to be present\par
    in your classpath at runtime. The annotations are not even \par
    referred to in your compiled .class files.\par
    \par
 2. Roo itself is a development time only tool. No Roo JARs whatsoever\par
    are required by your project at runtime.\par
\par
We trust the above clarifies our application of GPLv3 to Roo and that it \par
is not intended to cause people simply wishing to use Roo any unexpected\par
GPLv3-related implications. We only intend that GPLv3 impacts those\par
wishing to improve, build on, redistribute, extend etc Roo itself.\par

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\par
\par
1. Definitions\par
\par
"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\par
\par
"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\par
\par
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\par
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\par
\par
"Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\par
\par
"Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\par
\par
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\par
\par
"Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\par
\par
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\par
\par
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\par
\par
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\par
\par
to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\par
\par
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";\par
\par
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\par
\par
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\par
\par
For the avoidance of doubt:\par
\par
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\par
\par
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\par
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\par
\par
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\par
\par
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\par
\par
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work \par
\par
You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\par
\par
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\par
\par
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\par
\par
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\par
\par
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\par
\par
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
7. Termination\par
\par
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\par
\par
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\par
\par
8. Miscellaneous\par
\par
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
\par
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
\par
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\par
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\par
\par
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\par
\par
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\par

\par
The "Artistic License"\par
\par
				Preamble\par
\par
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a\par
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some\par
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,\par
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute\par
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make\par
reasonable modifications.\par
\par
Definitions:\par
\par
	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the\par
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\par
	created through textual modification.\par
\par
	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been\par
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\par
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.\par
\par
	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or\par
	copyrights for the package.\par
\par
	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing\par
	this Package.\par
\par
	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the\par
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,\par
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the\par
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large\par
	as a market that must bear the fee.)\par
\par
	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item\par
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.\par
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\par
	under the same conditions they received it.\par
\par
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\par
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you\par
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\par
\par
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\par
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\par
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\par
\par
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\par
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\par
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\par
following:\par
\par
    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\par
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or\par
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive\par
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include\par
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\par
\par
    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\par
\par
    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\par
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\par
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\par
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\par
\par
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\par
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\par
\par
    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\par
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\par
    to get the Standard Version.\par
\par
    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\par
    the Package with your modifications.\par
\par
    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\par
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\par
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\par
\par
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this\par
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this\par
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\par
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly\par
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software\par
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\par
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within\par
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere\par
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the\par
interpreter is so embedded.\par
\par
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\par
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\par
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\par
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\par
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\par
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a\par
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\par
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\par
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\par
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\par
Package.\par
\par
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other\par
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to\par
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this\par
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the\par
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do\par
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the\par
regression tests for the language.\par
\par
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always\par
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,\par
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible\par
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be\par
construed as a distribution of this Package.\par
\par
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\par
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\par
\par
10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR\par
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED\par
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\par

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\par
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\par
\par
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\par
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\par
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\par
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\par
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\par
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\par
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\par
\par
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\par
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\par
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\par
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\par
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\par
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\par
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\par
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\par
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\par
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\par
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\par
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\par
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\par
\par
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\par
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\par
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\par
\par
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\par

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\par
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\par
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\par
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\par
\par
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\par
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\par

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\par
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\par
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\par
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\par
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\par
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\par
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\par
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\par
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\par
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\par
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\par
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\par
\par
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\par
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\par
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\par
      meet the following conditions:\par
\par
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\par
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\par
\par
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\par
          stating that You changed the files; and\par
\par
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\par
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\par
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\par
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\par
          the Derivative Works; and\par
\par
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\par
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\par
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\par
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\par
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\par
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\par
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\par
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\par
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\par
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\par
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\par
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\par
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\par
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\par
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\par
          as modifying the License.\par
\par
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\par
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\par
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\par
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\par
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\par
      the conditions stated in this License.\par
\par
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\par
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\par
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\par
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\par
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\par
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\par
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\par
\par
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\par
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\par
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\par
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\par
\par
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\par
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\par
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\par
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\par
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\par
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\par
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\par
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\par
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\par
\par
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\par
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\par
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\par
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\par
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\par
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\par
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\par
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\par
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\par
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\par
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\par
\par
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\par
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\par
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\par
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\par
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\par
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\par
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\par
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\par
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\par
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\par

and other laws.  Title to the Software Packages and any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion shall \par
remain with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable license.  The "JBoss" trademark, "Red Hat" trademark, the \par
individual Software Package trademarks, and the "Shadowman" logo are registered trademarks of Red Hat and its affiliates \par
in the U.S. and other countries.  This agreement permits Client to distribute unmodified copies of the Software Packages \par
using the Red Hat trademarks that Red Hat has inserted in the Software Packages on the condition that Client follows Red Hat's \par
trademark guidelines for those trademarks located at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/.  Client must abide by \par
these trademark guidelines when distributing the Software Packages, regardless of whether the Software Packages have been modified. \par
If Client modifies the Software Packages, then Client must replace all Red Hat trademarks and logos identified at \par
http://www.jboss.com/company/logos, unless a separate agreement with Red Hat is executed or other permission granted.  \par
Merely deleting the files containing the Red Hat trademarks may corrupt the Software Packages.  \par
\par
3.  Limited Warranty.  Except as specifically stated in this Paragraph 3 or a license for a particular \par
component, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Software Packages and the \par
components are provided and licensed "as is" without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, \par
including the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose.  \par
Red Hat warrants that the media on which Software Packages may be furnished will be free from defects in \par
materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of 30 days from the date of delivery to Client.  \par
Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in the Software Packages will meet Client's requirements \par
or that the operation of the Software Packages will be entirely error free or appear precisely as described \par
in the accompanying documentation. This warranty extends only to the party that purchases the Services \par
pertaining to the Software Packages from Red Hat or a Red Hat authorized distributor. \par
\par
4.  Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the remedies \par
described below are accepted by Client as its only remedies.  Red Hat's entire liability, and Client's \par
exclusive remedies, shall be: If the Software media is defective, Client may return it within 30 days of \par
delivery along with a copy of Client's payment receipt and Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or \par
refund the money paid by Client for the Software.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, \par
Red Hat or any Red Hat authorized dealer will not be liable to Client for any incidental or consequential \par
damages, including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Software, \par
even if Red Hat or such dealer has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  In no event shall \par
Red Hat's liability under this agreement exceed the amount that Client paid to Red Hat under this \par
Agreement during the twelve months preceding the action.\par
\par
5.  Export Control.  As required by U.S. law, Client represents and warrants that it: \par
(a) understands that the Software Packages are subject to export controls under the \par
U.S. Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"); \par
\par
(b) is not located in a prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions regulations \par
(currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria); \par
\par
(c) will not export, re-export, or transfer the Software Packages to any prohibited destination, entity, \par
or individual without the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s) from the U.S. Government; \par
\par
(d) will not use or transfer the Software Packages for use in any sensitive nuclear, chemical or \par
biological weapons, or missile technology end-uses unless authorized by the U.S. Government by \par
regulation or specific license; \par
\par
(e) understands and agrees that if it is in the United States and exports or transfers the Software \par
Packages to eligible end users, it will, as required by EAR Section 740.17(e), submit semi-annual \par
reports to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry & Security (BIS), which include the name and \par
address (including country) of each transferee; \par
\par
and (f) understands that countries other than the United States may restrict the import, use, or \par
export of encryption products and that it shall be solely responsible for compliance with any such \par
import, use, or export restrictions.\par
\par
6.  Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software programs with the Software Packages \par
that are not part of the Software Packages and which Client must install separately.  These third party \par
programs are subject to their own license terms.  The license terms either accompany the programs or \par
can be viewed at http://www.redhat.com/licenses/.  If Client does not agree to abide by the applicable \par
license terms for such programs, then Client may not install them.  If Client wishes to install the programs \par
on more than one system or transfer the programs to another party, then Client must contact the licensor \par
of the programs.\par
\par
7.  General.  If any provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable, that shall not affect the \par
enforceability of the remaining provisions.  This License Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the \par
State of North Carolina and of the United States, without regard to any conflict of laws provisions, \par
except that the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.\par

SOFTWARE RIGHTS\par

ANTLR 1989-2005 Developed by Terence Parr\par
Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com\par
\par
We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the\par
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever\par
they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the\par
code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of\par
ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.\par
\par
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,\par
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing\par
ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or\par
incorporate any source code into one of your programs\par
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that\par
you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,\par
research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have\par
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that\par
you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the\par
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these\par
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this\par
system and expect to make other tools available as they are\par
completed.\par

\par
<p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. </p>\par
\par
<p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. </p>\par
\par
\par
<p><strong>1. Definitions</strong> </p>\par
\par
<ol type="a">\par
\par
<li>\par
<strong>"Collective Work"</strong> means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
<strong>"Derivative Work"</strong> means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
<strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
<strong>"Original Author"</strong> means the individual or entity who created the Work.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
<strong>"Work"</strong> means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
<strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\par
\par
</li>\par
</ol>\par
\par
<p><strong>2. Fair Use Rights.</strong> Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. </p>\par
\par
\par
<p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: </p>\par
\par
\par
<ol type="a">\par
<li>\par
\par
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\par
\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:</p>\par
\par
<ol type="i">\par
<li><strong>Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses</strong>. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.</li>\par
\par
<li><strong>Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).</li></ol></li>\par
\par
<li><strong>Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).</li>\par
\par
</ol>\par
\par
\par
<p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>\par
\par
<p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong>The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: </p>\par
\par
\par
<ol type="a">\par
<li>\par
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.\par
</li>\par
\par
\par
<li>\par
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\par
</li>\par
\par
</ol>\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
<p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>\par
\par
<p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\par
\par
\par
<p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>\par
\par
<p><strong>7. Termination</strong> </p>\par
\par
<ol type="a">\par
\par
<li>\par
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\par
</li>\par
</ol>\par
\par
<p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong> </p>\par
\par
<ol type="a">\par
\par
<li>\par
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\par
\par
</li>\par
\par
<li>\par
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\par

      ============================\par
\par
      Copyright (c) 2005 Bob Ippolito.  All rights reserved.\par
\par
      This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:\par
\par
      Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1\par
\par
      1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:\par
\par
      a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;\par
\par
      b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;\par
\par
      c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;\par
\par
      d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\par
\par
      e) to display the Original Work publicly.\par
\par
      2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.\par
\par
      3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\par
\par
      4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\par
\par
      5) This section intentionally omitted.\par
\par
      6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\par
\par
      7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\par
\par
      8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\par
\par
      9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\par
\par
      10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\par
\par
      11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.  101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\par
\par
      12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\par
\par
      13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\par
\par
      14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.

\par
      <p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. </p>\par
\par
      <p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. </p>\par
\par
\par
      <p><strong>1. Definitions</strong> </p>\par
\par
      <ol type="a">\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"Collective Work"</strong> means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"Derivative Work"</strong> means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"Original Author"</strong> means the individual or entity who created the Work.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"Work"</strong> means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      <strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\par
\par
      </li>\par
      </ol>\par
\par
      <p><strong>2. Fair Use Rights.</strong> Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. </p>\par
\par
\par
      <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: </p>\par
\par
\par
      <ol type="a">\par
      <li>\par
\par
      to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\par
\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:</p>\par
\par
      <ol type="i">\par
      <li><strong>Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses</strong>. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.</li>\par
\par
      <li><strong>Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).</li></ol></li>\par
\par
      <li><strong>Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).</li>\par
\par
      </ol>\par
\par
\par
      <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>\par
\par
      <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong>The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: </p>\par
\par
\par
      <ol type="a">\par
      <li>\par
      You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.\par
      </li>\par
\par
\par
      <li>\par
      If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      </ol>\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
      <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>\par
\par
      <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\par
\par
\par
      <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>\par
\par
      <p><strong>7. Termination</strong> </p>\par
\par
      <ol type="a">\par
\par
      <li>\par
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\par
      </li>\par
      </ol>\par
\par
      <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong> </p>\par
\par
      <ol type="a">\par
\par
      <li>\par
      Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\par
\par
      </li>\par
\par
      <li>\par
      This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\par

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition.

This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition.

ANTLR 1989-2006 Developed by Terence Parr\par
Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com\par
\par
We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the\par
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever\par
they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the\par
code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of\par
ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.\par
\par
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,\par
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing\par
ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or\par
incorporate any source code into one of your programs\par
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that\par
you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,\par
research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have\par
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that\par
you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the\par
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these\par
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this\par
system and expect to make other tools available as they are\par
completed.\par

LEGAL NOTICES\par
======================================================================\par
\par
Roo is copyright (C) 2008-2010 SpringSource Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par
\par
Roo is licensed under the GPLv3: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\par
\par
The contents of roo-annotations-*.jar are dual licensed under both the\par
GPLv3 and also the Apache License, Version 2.0: \par
\par
     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html. \par
\par
You may apply your choice of GPLv3 or ASLv2 to your use of the\par
roo-annotations-*.jar file.\par
\par
Ensuring an ASLv2 license is provided for the roo-annotations-*.jar\par
file is SpringSource's reassurance that we do not intend for GPLv3\par
obligations to extend to people simply using Roo to build software.\par
\par
In connection with the annotations, we further note:\par
\par
 1. The annotations are source level retention only. As such there is\par
    no requirement for the roo-annotations-*.jar file to be present\par
    in your classpath at runtime. The annotations are not even \par
    referred to in your compiled .class files.\par
    \par
 2. Roo itself is a development time only tool. No Roo JARs whatsoever\par
    are required by your project at runtime.\par
\par
We trust the above clarifies our application of GPLv3 to Roo and that it \par
is not intended to cause people simply wishing to use Roo any unexpected\par
GPLv3-related implications. We only intend that GPLv3 impacts those\par
wishing to improve, build on, redistribute, extend etc Roo itself.\par

1. Definitions\par
\par
"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\par
\par
"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\par
\par
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\par
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\par
\par
"Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\par
\par
"Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\par
\par
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\par
\par
"Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\par
\par
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\par
\par
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\par
\par
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\par
\par
to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\par
\par
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";\par
\par
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\par
\par
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\par
\par
For the avoidance of doubt:\par
\par
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\par
\par
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\par
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\par
\par
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\par
\par
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\par
\par
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work \par
\par
You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\par
\par
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\par
\par
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\par
\par
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\par
\par
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\par
\par
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
7. Termination\par
\par
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\par
\par
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\par
\par
8. Miscellaneous\par
\par
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
\par
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
\par
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\par
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\par
\par
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\par
\par
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\par

The "Artistic License"\par
\par
				Preamble\par
\par
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a\par
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some\par
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,\par
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute\par
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make\par
reasonable modifications.\par
\par
Definitions:\par
\par
	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the\par
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\par
	created through textual modification.\par
\par
	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been\par
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\par
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.\par
\par
	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or\par
	copyrights for the package.\par
\par
	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing\par
	this Package.\par
\par
	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the\par
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,\par
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the\par
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large\par
	as a market that must bear the fee.)\par
\par
	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item\par
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.\par
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\par
	under the same conditions they received it.\par
\par
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\par
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you\par
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\par
\par
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\par
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\par
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\par
\par
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\par
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\par
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\par
following:\par
\par
    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\par
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or\par
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive\par
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include\par
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\par
\par
    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\par
\par
    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\par
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\par
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\par
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\par
\par
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\par
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\par
\par
    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\par
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\par
    to get the Standard Version.\par
\par
    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\par
    the Package with your modifications.\par
\par
    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\par
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\par
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\par
\par
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this\par
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this\par
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\par
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly\par
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software\par
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\par
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within\par
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere\par
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the\par
interpreter is so embedded.\par
\par
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\par
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\par
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\par
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\par
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\par
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a\par
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\par
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\par
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\par
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\par
Package.\par
\par
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other\par
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to\par
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this\par
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the\par
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do\par
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the\par
regression tests for the language.\par
\par
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always\par
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,\par
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible\par
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be\par
construed as a distribution of this Package.\par
\par
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\par

\par
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\par
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\par
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\par
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\par
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\par
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\par
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\par
\par

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\par
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\par
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\par
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\par
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\par
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\par
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\par
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\par
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\par
\par
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\par
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\par

          stating that You changed the files; and\par
\par
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\par
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\par
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\par
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\par
          the Derivative Works; and\par
\par
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\par
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\par
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\par
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\par
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\par
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\par
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\par
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\par
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\par
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\par
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\par
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\par
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\par
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\par
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\par
          as modifying the License.\par
\par
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\par
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\par
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\par
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\par
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\par
      the conditions stated in this License.\par
\par
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\par
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\par
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\par
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\par
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\par
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\par
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\par
\par
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\par
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\par
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\par
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\par
\par
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\par
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\par
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\par
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\par
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\par
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\par
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\par
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\par
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\par
\par
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\par
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\par
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\par
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\par
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\par
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\par
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\par
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\par
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\par
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\par
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\par
\par
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\par
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\par
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\par
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\par
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\par
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\par
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\par
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\par
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\par
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\par

MySQL FLOSS License Exception\par
\par
The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source\par
Software-only Applications Using MySQL Client Libraries (the\par
"FLOSS Exception").\par
\par
Version 0.6, 7 March 2007\par
\par
Exception Intent\par
\par
We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'')\par
applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client\par
libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS\par
licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public\par
License (the ``GPL'').\par
\par
Legal Terms and Conditions\par
\par
As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0\par
of the GPL:\par
\par
 1. You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed\par
    entirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a\par
    "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of the licenses\par
    listed below in section 1, as long as:\par
      a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the\par
         Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the\par
         Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program,\par
         and which can reasonably be considered independent and\par
         separate works in themselves,\par
      b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which\par
         are not derived from the Program, and which can\par
         reasonably be considered independent and separate works\par
         in themselves,\par
           i. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses\par
              listed below, and\par
          ii. the object code or executable form of those sections\par
              are accompanied by the complete corresponding\par
              machine-readable source code for those sections on\par
              the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as\par
              the corresponding object code or executable forms of\par
              those sections, and\par
      c. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a\par
         Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution\par
         medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be\par
         considered independent and separate works in themselves\par
         which are not derivatives of either the Program, a\par
         Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.\par
    If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only\par
    be copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and\par
    conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from\par
    MySQL AB.\par

    Due to the many variants of some of the above licenses, we\par
    require that any version follow the 2003 version of the Free\par
    Software Foundation's Free Software Definition\par
    (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or version 1.9 of\par

\par
 3. Definitions\par
\par
      a. Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the\par
         meaning provided in the GPL.\par
      b. Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright\par
         law.\par
\par
 4. Applicability: This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs\par
    that contain a notice placed by MySQL AB saying that the\par
    Program may be distributed under the terms of this FLOSS\par
    Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is a\par
    Derivative Work of both the Program and any other work\par
    licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not\par
    available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS\par
    Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all\par
    respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may\par
    choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under\par
    the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice\par
    from that copy of the Program, provided that the copy has\par
    never been modified by you or any third party.\par
\par

\par
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,\par
that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial\par
revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,\par
as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this\par
License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable\par
from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work\par
and Derivative Works thereof.\par
\par
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the\par

\par
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\par
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\par

\par
2. Grant of Copyright License.\par
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor\par
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,\par
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare\par
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and\par
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\par
\par
3. Grant of Patent License.\par
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor\par
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,\par
royalty- free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent\par
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and\par
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those\par
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily\par
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of\par
their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)\par
was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity\par
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\par
Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\par
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted\par
to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date\par
such litigation is filed.\par
\par
4. Redistribution.\par
You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works\par
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or\par
Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\par
\par
  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works\par
     a copy of this License; and\par
\par
  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating\par
     that You changed the files; and\par
\par
  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that\par
     You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution\par
     notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices\par
     that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\par
\par
  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\par
     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\par
     include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\par
     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\par
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of\par
     the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part\par
     of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,\par
     if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display\par
     generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party\par
     notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for\par
     informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You\par
     may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that\par
     You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text\par
     from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices\par
     cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own\par
     copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional\par
     or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or\par
     distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works\par
     as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the\par
     Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\par
\par
5. Submission of Contributions.\par
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally\par
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be\par
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional\par
terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall\par
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may\par
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\par
\par
6. Trademarks.\par
This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,\par
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for\par
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and\par
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\par
\par
7. Disclaimer of Warranty.\par
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor\par
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on\par
an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either\par
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or\par
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR\par
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\par
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks\par
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\par
\par
8. Limitation of Liability.\par
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\par
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law\par
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,\par
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,\par
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character\par
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to\par
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\par
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other\par
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised\par
of the possibility of such damages.\par
\par
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.\par
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may\par
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,\par
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with\par
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\par
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of\par
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and\par
hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims\par
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such\par
warranty or additional liability.\par

\par
3. Distribution Obligations.\par
\par
3.1. Availability of Source Code.\par
\par
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\par
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and\par
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this\par
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the\par
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make\par
available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in\par
Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source\par
Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\par
for software exchange.\par
\par
3.2. Modifications.\par
\par
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed\par
by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your\par
Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient\par
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\par
\par
3.3. Required Notices.\par
\par
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies\par
You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter\par
any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered\par
Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\par
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\par
\par
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\par
\par
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source\par
Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License\par
or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to\par
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to\par
one or more recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only\par
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\par
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\par
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\par
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\par
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor\par
as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\par
\par
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\par
\par
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the\par
terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,\par
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are\par
in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\par
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights\par
in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If\par
You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different\par
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\par
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer\par
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\par
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\par
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\par
\par
3.6. Larger Works.\par
\par
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code\par
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work\par
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\par
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\par
\par
4. Versions of the License. \par
\par
4.1. New Versions.\par
\par
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish\par
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each\par
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided\par
in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to\par
modify this License.\par
\par
4.2. Effect of New Versions.\par
\par
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered\par
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under\par
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\par
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it\par
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent\par
version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software\par
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You\par
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose\par
to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available\par
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\par
the license steward.\par
\par
4.3. Modified Versions.\par
\par
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license\par
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of\par
this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references\par
to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license\par
differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the\par
license contains terms which differ from this License.\par
\par
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\par
\par
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,\par
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\par
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF\par
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE\par
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE\par
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\par
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST\par
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\par
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY\par
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\par
\par
6. TERMINATION. \par
\par
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\par
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\par
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions\par
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\par
this License shall survive.\par
\par
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\par
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the\par
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is\par
referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software\par
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\par
or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)\par
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\par
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\par
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all\par
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60\par
days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically\par
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such\par
60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\par
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a\par
written agreement with Participant.\par
\par
6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\par
user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor\par
hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by\par
any distributor) shall survive termination.\par
\par
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\par
\par
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\par
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\par
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER\par
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\par
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\par
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,\par
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES\par
OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY\par
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY\par
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO\par
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS\par
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\par
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\par
\par
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\par
\par
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined\par
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\par
software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and\par
"commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in\par
48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\par
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End\par
Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\par
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any\par
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government\par
rights in computer software under this License.\par
\par
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\par
\par
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\par
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,\par
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\par
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\par
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to\par
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\par
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to\par
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located\par
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within\par
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,\par
including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'\par
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\par
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any\par
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\par
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\par
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\par
States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and\par
regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise\par
make available any Covered Software.\par
\par
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\par
\par
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\par
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out\par
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work\par
with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility\par
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to\par
constitute any admission of liability.\par

   of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the\par
   Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or\par
   more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent\par
   works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective\par

   from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a\par
   previous violation.\par
\par
   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the\par
   Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by\par

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\par
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\par
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\par
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\par
\par
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\par
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\par
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\par
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\par
\par
   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or\par
   more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\par
   Collections;\par
\par
   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such\par
   Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable\par
   steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes\par
   were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be\par
   marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or\par
   a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";\par
\par
   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as\par
   incorporated in Collections; and,\par
\par
   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\par
\par
   e. For the avoidance of doubt:\par
\par
      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions\par
      in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\par
      compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves\par
      the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\par
      You of the rights granted under this License;\par
\par
      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions\par
      in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\par
      compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\par
      exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\par
      of the rights granted under this License; and,\par
\par
      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right\par
      to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that\par
      the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\par
      voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\par
      by You of the rights granted under this License.  The above rights\par
      may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or\par
      hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such\par
      modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\par
      in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights\par
      not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\par
\par
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\par
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\par
\par
   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the\par
   terms of this License.  You must include a copy of, or the Uniform\par
   Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the\par
   Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose\par
   any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the\par
   ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to\par
   that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense\par
   the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License\par
   and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\par
   Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform\par
   the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on\par
   the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from\par
   You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms\par
   of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated\par
   in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from\par
   the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If\par
   You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must,\par
   to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\par
   required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation,\par
   upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,\par
   remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b),\par
   as requested.\par
\par
   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations\par
   or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant\par
   to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\par
   provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\par
   name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\par
   and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\par
   or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal)\par
   for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright\par
   notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of\par
   such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii)\par
   to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\par
   specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\par
   refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\par
   and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\par
   a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\par
   "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay\par
   based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required\par
   by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\par
   provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\par
   a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\par
   authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of\par
   these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits\par
   for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You\par
   may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of\par
   attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights\par
   under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or\par
   imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original\par
   Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You\par
   or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\par
   permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\par
\par
   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\par
   otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute\par
   or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\par
   Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify\par
   or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would\par
   be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor\par
   agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\par
   of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\par
   make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\par
   modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\par
   Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\par
   as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\par
   applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\par
   right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\par
   but not otherwise.\par
\par
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\par
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\par
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\par
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\par
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\par
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\par
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\par
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\par
OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\par
\par
6. Limitation on Liability.\par
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR\par
BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,\par
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS\par
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF\par
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
7. Termination\par
\par
   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\par
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\par
   License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or\par
   Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their\par
   licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in\par
   full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8\par
   will survive any termination of this License.\par
\par
   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\par
   here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in\par
   the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to\par
   release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing\par
   the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not\par
   serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been,\par
   or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and\par
   this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated\par
   as stated above.\par
\par
8. Miscellaneous\par
\par
   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\par
   Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\par
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\par
   under this License.\par
\par
   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\par
   offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\par
   terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\par
\par
   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\par
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\par
   of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further\par
   action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be\par
   reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid\par
   and enforceable.\par
\par
   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\par
   breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\par
   and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\par
\par
   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\par
   with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\par
   agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\par
   here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\par
   may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\par
   modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\par
\par
   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\par
   License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\par
   for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\par
   September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\par
   Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and\par
   the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These\par
   rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction\par
   in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to\par
   the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty\par
   provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of\par
   rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional\par
   rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are\par
   deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended\par
   to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\par

--------------- SECTION 4: GNU Lesser General Public License, V2.1 -----------\par
\par
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
		       Version 2.1, February 1999\par
\par
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\par
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\par
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\par
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\par
 the version number 2.1.]\par
\par
			    Preamble\par
\par
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\par
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\par
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\par
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\par
\par
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\par
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\par
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\par
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\par
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\par
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\par
\par
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\par
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\par
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\par
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\par
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\par
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\par
these things.\par
\par
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\par
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\par
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\par
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\par
\par
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\par
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\par
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\par
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\par
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\par
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\par
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
\par
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\par
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\par
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\par
\par
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\par
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\par
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\par
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\par
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\par
introduced by others.\par
\par
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\par
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\par
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\par
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\par
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\par
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\par
\par
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\par
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\par
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\par
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\par
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\par
libraries into non-free programs.\par
\par
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\par
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\par
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\par
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\par
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\par
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\par
the library.\par
\par
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\par
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\par
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\par
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\par
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\par
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\par
special circumstances.\par
\par
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\par
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\par
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\par
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\par
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\par
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\par
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\par
\par
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\par
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\par
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\par
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\par
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\par
system.\par
\par
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\par
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\par
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\par
that program using a modified version of the Library.\par
\par
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\par
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\par
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\par
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\par
be combined with the library in order to run.\par
\par
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
\par
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\par
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\par
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\par
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\par
Each licensee is addressed as "you".\par
\par
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\par
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\par
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\par
\par
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\par
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\par
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\par
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\par
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\par
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\par
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\par
\par
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\par
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\par
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\par
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\par
and installation of the library.\par
\par
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\par
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\par
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\par
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\par
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\par
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\par
and what the program that uses the Library does.\par
\par
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\par
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\par
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\par
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\par
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\par
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\par
Library.\par
\par
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\par
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\par
fee.\par
\par
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\par
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\par
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\par
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\par
\par
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\par
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
\par
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\par
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\par
\par
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\par
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\par
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\par
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\par
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\par
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\par
    its purpose remains meaningful.\par
\par
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\par
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\par
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\par
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\par
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\par
    root function must still compute square roots.)\par
\par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\par
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\par
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\par
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\par
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\par
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\par
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\par
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\par
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\par
it.\par
\par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\par
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\par
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\par
collective works based on the Library.\par
\par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\par
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\par
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\par
the scope of this License.\par
\par
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\par
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\par
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\par
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\par
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\par
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\par
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\par
these notices.\par
\par
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\par
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\par
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\par
\par
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\par
the Library into a program that is not a library.\par
\par
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\par
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\par
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\par
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\par
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\par
medium customarily used for software interchange.\par
\par
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\par
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\par
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\par
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\par
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
\par
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\par
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\par
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\par
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\par
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\par
\par
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\par
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\par
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\par
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\par
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\par
\par
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\par
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\par
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\par
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\par
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\par
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\par
\par
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\par
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\par
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\par
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\par
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\par
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\par
\par
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\par
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\par
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\par
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\par
\par
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\par
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\par
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\par
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\par
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\par
engineering for debugging such modifications.\par
\par
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\par
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\par
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\par
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\par
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\par
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\par
of these things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\par
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\par
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\par
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\par
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\par
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\par
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\par
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\par
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\par
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\par
    to use the modified definitions.)\par
\par
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\par
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\par
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\par
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\par
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\par
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\par
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\par
\par
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\par
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\par
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\par
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\par
\par
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\par
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\par
    specified materials from the same place.\par
\par
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\par
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\par
\par
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\par
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\par
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\par
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\par
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\par
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\par
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\par
the executable.\par
\par
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\par
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\par
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\par
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\par
distribute.\par
\par
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\par
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\par
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\par
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\par
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\par
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\par
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\par
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\par
    Sections above.\par
\par
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\par
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\par
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\par
\par
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\par
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\par
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\par
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\par
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\par
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\par
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\par
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\par
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\par
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\par
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\par
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\par
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\par
the Library or works based on it.\par
\par
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\par
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\par
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\par
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\par
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\par
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\par
this License.\par
\par
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\par
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\par
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\par
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\par
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\par
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\par
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\par
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\par
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\par
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\par
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\par
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\par
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\par
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\par
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\par
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\par
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\par
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\par
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\par
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\par
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\par
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\par
impose that choice.\par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\par
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\par
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\par
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\par
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\par
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\par
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\par
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\par
written in the body of this License.\par
\par
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\par
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\par
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\par
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\par
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\par
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\par
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\par
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\par
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\par
the Free Software Foundation.\par
\par
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\par
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\par
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\par
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\par
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\par
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\par
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\par
and reuse of software generally.\par
\par
			    NO WARRANTY\par
\par
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\par
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\par
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\par
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\par
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\par
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\par
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\par
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\par
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\par
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\par
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\par
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\par
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\par
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\par
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\par
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\par
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\par
DAMAGES.\par
\par
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
\par
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\par
\par
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\par
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\par
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\par
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\par
ordinary General Public License).\par
\par
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\par
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\par
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\par
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\par
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\par
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\par
\par
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\par
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\par
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\par
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\par
\par
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\par
    Lesser General Public License for more details.\par
\par
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\par
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\par
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\par
\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\par
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\par
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\par
\par
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\par
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\par
\par
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\par
  Ty Coon, President of Vice\par
\par
That's all there is to it!\par

\par
Artistic License 2.0\par
\par
Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.\par
\par
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
Preamble\par
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.\par
\par
You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.\par
\par
Definitions\par
\par
"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\par
\par
"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.\par
\par
"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.\par
\par
"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.\par
\par
"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\par
\par
"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.\par
\par
"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\par
\par
"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.\par
\par
"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.\par
Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\par
\par
(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\par
\par
Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\par
\par
(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.\par
\par
(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.\par
\par
Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\par
\par
(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of \par
the following:\par
\par
(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. \par
\par
(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version. \par
\par
(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under \par
\par
(i) the Original License or \par
(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.\par
\par
Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions \par
without the Source\par
\par
(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\par
\par
(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.\par
\par
Aggregating or Linking the Package\par
\par
(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.\par
\par
(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\par
\par
Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\par
\par
(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.\par
\par
General Provisions\par
\par
(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.\par
\par
(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.\par
\par
(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\par
\par
(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. \par
\par
If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.\par
\par
(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER \par
AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED \par
WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A \par
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT \par
PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT \par
HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, \par
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE \par
USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\par

\par
		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\par
\par
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\par
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
\par
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates\par
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\par
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\par
\par
  0. Additional Definitions.\par
\par
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\par
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU\par
General Public License.\par
\par
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\par
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\par
\par
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\par
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\par
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\par
of using an interface provided by the Library.\par
\par
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an\par
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\par
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked\par
Version".\par
\par
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the\par
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\par
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\par
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\par
\par
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the\par
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\par
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\par
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\par
\par
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\par
\par
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\par
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\par
\par
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\par
\par
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\par
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\par
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\par
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\par
version:\par
\par
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\par
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\par
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\par
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\par
\par
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\par
   this License applicable to that copy.\par
\par
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\par
\par
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\par
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\par
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\par
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\par
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\par
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\par
\par
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\par
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\par
   covered by this License.\par
\par
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\par
   document.\par
\par
  4. Combined Works.\par
\par
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\par
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\par
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\par
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\par
the following:\par
\par
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\par
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\par
   covered by this License.\par
\par
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\par
   document.\par
\par
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\par
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\par
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\par
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\par
\par
   d) Do one of the following:\par
\par
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\par
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\par
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\par
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\par
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\par
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\par
       Corresponding Source.\par
\par
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\par
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\par
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\par
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\par
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\par
       Version.\par
\par
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\par
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\par
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\par
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\par
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\par
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\par
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\par
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\par
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\par
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\par
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\par
\par
  5. Combined Libraries.\par
\par
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\par
Library side by side in a single library together with other library\par
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\par
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\par
choice, if you do both of the following:\par
\par
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\par
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\par
   conveyed under the terms of this License.\par
\par
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\par
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\par
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\par
\par
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\par
\par
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\par
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\par
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\par
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\par
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\par
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"\par
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\par
conditions either of that published version or of any later version\par
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\par
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\par
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\par
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\par
\par
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\par
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\par
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\par
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\par
Library.\par
\par

--------------- SECTION 7: GNU Library General Public License, V2.0 -----------\par
\par
		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
		       Version 2, June 1991\par
\par
 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\par
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\par
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is\par
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\par
\par
			    Preamble\par
\par
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\par
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\par
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\par
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\par
\par
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\par
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\par
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\par
your libraries, too.\par
\par
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\par
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\par
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\par
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\par
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\par
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\par
\par
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\par
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\par
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\par
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\par
\par
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\par
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\par
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\par
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\par
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\par
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\par
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
\par
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\par
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\par
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\par
\par
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\par
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\par
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\par
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\par
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\par
the original authors' reputations.\par
\par
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\par
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\par
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\par
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\par
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\par
free use or not licensed at all.\par
\par
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\par
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\par
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\par
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\par
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\par
the same as in the ordinary license.\par
\par
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\par
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\par
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\par
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\par
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\par
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\par
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\par
treats it as such.\par
\par
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\par
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\par
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\par
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\par
\par
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\par
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\par
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\par
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\par
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\par
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\par
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\par
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\par
will lead to faster development of free libraries.\par
\par
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\par
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\par
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\par
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\par
works together with the library.\par
\par
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\par

\par
		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
\par
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\par
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\par
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\par
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\par
addressed as "you".\par
\par
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\par
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\par
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\par
\par
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\par
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\par
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\par
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\par
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\par
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\par
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\par
\par
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\par
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\par
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\par
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\par
and installation of the library.\par
\par
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\par
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\par
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\par
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\par
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\par
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\par
and what the program that uses the Library does.\par
  \par
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\par
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\par
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\par
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\par
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\par
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\par
Library.\par
\par
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\par
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\par
fee.\par
\par
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\par
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\par
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\par
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\par
\par
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\par
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
\par
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\par
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\par
\par
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\par
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\par
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\par
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\par
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\par
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\par
    its purpose remains meaningful.\par
\par
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\par
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\par
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\par
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\par
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\par
    root function must still compute square roots.)\par
\par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\par
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\par
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\par
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\par
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\par
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\par
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\par
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\par
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\par
it.\par
\par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\par
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\par
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\par
collective works based on the Library.\par
\par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\par
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\par
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\par
the scope of this License.\par
\par
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\par
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\par
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\par
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\par
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\par
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\par
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\par
these notices.\par
\par
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\par
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\par
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\par
\par
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\par
the Library into a program that is not a library.\par
\par
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\par
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\par
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\par
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\par
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\par
medium customarily used for software interchange.\par
\par
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\par
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\par
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\par
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\par
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
\par
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\par
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\par
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\par
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\par
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\par
\par
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\par
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\par
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\par
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\par
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\par
\par
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\par
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\par
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\par
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\par
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\par
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\par
\par
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\par
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\par
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\par
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\par
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\par
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\par
\par
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\par
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\par
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\par
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\par
\par
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\par
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\par
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\par
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\par
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\par
engineering for debugging such modifications.\par
\par
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\par
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\par
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\par
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\par
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\par
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\par
of these things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\par
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\par
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\par
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\par
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\par
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\par
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\par
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\par
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\par
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\par
    to use the modified definitions.)\par
\par
    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\par
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\par
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\par
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\par
\par
    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\par
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\par
    specified materials from the same place.\par
\par
    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\par
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\par
\par
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\par
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\par
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\par
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\par
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\par
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\par
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\par
the executable.\par
\par
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\par
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\par
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\par
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\par
distribute.\par
\par
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\par
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\par
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\par
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\par
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\par
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\par
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\par
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\par
    Sections above.\par
\par
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\par
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\par
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\par
\par
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\par
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\par
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\par
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\par
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\par
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\par
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\par
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\par
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\par
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\par
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\par
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\par
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\par
the Library or works based on it.\par
\par
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\par
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\par
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\par
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\par
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\par
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\par
this License.\par
\par
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\par
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\par
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\par
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\par
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\par
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\par
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\par
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\par
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\par
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\par
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\par
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\par
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\par
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\par
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\par
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\par
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\par
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\par
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\par
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\par
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\par
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\par
impose that choice.\par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\par
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\par
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\par
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\par
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\par
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\par
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\par
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\par
written in the body of this License.\par
\par
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\par
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\par
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\par
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\par
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\par
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\par
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\par
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\par
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\par
the Free Software Foundation.\par
\par
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\par
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\par
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\par
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\par
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\par
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\par
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\par
and reuse of software generally.\par
\par
			    NO WARRANTY\par
\par
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\par
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\par
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\par
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\par
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\par
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\par
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\par
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\par
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\par
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\par
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\par
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\par
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\par
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\par
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\par
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\par
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\par
DAMAGES.\par
\par
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
\par
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\par
\par
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\par
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\par
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\par
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\par
ordinary General Public License).\par
\par
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\par
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\par
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\par
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\par
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\par
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\par
\par
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\par
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\par
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\par
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\par
\par
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\par
    Library General Public License for more details.\par
\par
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\par
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free\par
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\par
\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\par
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\par
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\par
\par
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\par
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\par
\par
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\par
  Ty Coon, President of Vice\par
\par
That's all there is to it!\par

--------------- SECTION 8: GNU General Public License, V2.0 -----------\par
\par
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
		       Version 2, June 1991\par
\par
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\par
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\par
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
			    Preamble\par
\par
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\par
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\par
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\par
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\par
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\par
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\par
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\par
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\par
your programs, too.\par
\par
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\par
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\par
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\par
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\par
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\par
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\par
\par
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\par
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\par
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\par
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\par
\par
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\par
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\par
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\par
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\par
rights.\par
\par
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\par
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\par
distribute and/or modify the software.\par
\par
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\par
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\par
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\par
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\par
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\par
authors' reputations.\par
\par
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\par
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\par
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\par
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\par
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\par
\par
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\par
modification follow.\par
\par
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
\par
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\par
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\par
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\par
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\par
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\par
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\par
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\par
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\par
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\par
\par
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\par
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\par
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\par
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\par
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\par
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\par
\par
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\par
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\par
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\par
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\par
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\par
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\par
along with the Program.\par
\par
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\par
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\par
\par
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\par
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\par
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\par
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\par
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
\par
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\par
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\par
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\par
    parties under the terms of this License.\par
\par
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\par
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\par
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\par
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\par
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\par
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\par
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\par
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\par
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\par
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\par
\par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\par
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\par
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\par
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\par
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\par
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\par
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\par
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\par
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\par
\par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\par
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\par
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\par
collective works based on the Program.\par
\par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\par
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\par
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\par
the scope of this License.\par
\par
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\par
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\par
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\par
\par
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\par
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\par
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\par
\par
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\par
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\par
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\par
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\par
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\par
    customarily used for software interchange; or,\par
\par
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\par
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\par
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\par
    received the program in object code or executable form with such\par
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\par
\par
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\par
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\par
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\par
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\par
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\par
special exception, the source code distributed need not include\par
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\par
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\par
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\par
itself accompanies the executable.\par
\par
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\par
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\par
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\par
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\par
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
\par
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\par
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\par
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\par
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\par
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\par
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\par
parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\par
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\par
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\par
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\par
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\par
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\par
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\par
the Program or works based on it.\par
\par
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\par
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\par
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\par
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\par
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\par
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\par
this License.\par
\par
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\par
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\par
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\par
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\par
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\par
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\par
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\par
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\par
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\par
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\par
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\par
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\par
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\par
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\par
circumstances.\par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\par
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\par
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\par
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\par
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\par
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\par
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\par
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\par
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\par
impose that choice.\par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\par
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\par
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\par
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\par
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\par
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\par
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\par
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\par
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\par
\par
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\par
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\par
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\par
address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\par
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\par
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\par
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\par
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\par
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\par
Foundation.\par
\par
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\par
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\par
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\par
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\par
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\par
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\par
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\par
\par
			    NO WARRANTY\par
\par
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\par
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\par
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\par
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\par
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\par
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\par
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\par
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\par
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\par
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\par
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\par
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\par
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\par
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\par
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\par
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\par
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
\par
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\par
\par
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\par
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\par
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\par
\par
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\par
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\par
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\par
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\par
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\par
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\par
\par
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\par
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\par
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\par
    (at your option) any later version.\par
\par
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\par
    GNU General Public License for more details.\par
\par
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\par
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\par
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\par
\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
\par
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\par
when it starts in an interactive mode:\par
\par
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\par
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\par
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\par
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\par
\par
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\par
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\par
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\par
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\par
\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\par
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if\par
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\par
\par
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\par
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\par
\par
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\par
  Ty Coon, President of Vice\par
\par
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\par
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\par
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\par
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\par
Public License instead of this License.\par
\par
\par
--------------- SECTION 9: Eclipse Public License, V1.0 -----------\par
\par
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0\par
\par
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\par
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\par
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\par
1. DEFINITIONS\par
\par
"Contribution" means:\par
\par
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\par
    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\par
\par
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\par
\par
        i) changes to the Program, and\par
\par
        ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or\par
        additions to the Program originate from and are distributed\par
        by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\par
        from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\par
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\par
        behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program\par
        which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\par
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\par
        and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\par
\par
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\par
\par
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\par
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\par
or when combined with the Program.\par
\par
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\par
Agreement.\par
\par
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\par
including all Contributors.\par
\par
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\par
\par
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\par
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\par
    license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\par
    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\par
    Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\par
    object code form.\par
\par
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\par
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\par
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\par
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\par
    if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license\par
    shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\par
    if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\par
    addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered\par
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\par
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per\par
    se is licensed hereunder.\par
\par
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\par
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\par
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\par
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\par
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\par
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\par
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\par
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility\par
    to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\par
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow\par
    Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\par
    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\par
\par
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\par
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\par
    license set forth in this Agreement.\par
\par
3. REQUIREMENTS\par
\par
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\par
under its own license agreement, provided that:\par
\par
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\par
\par
    b) its license agreement:\par
\par
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\par
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\par
        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\par
        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\par
        for a particular purpose;\par
\par
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\par
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\par
        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\par
\par
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\par
        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\par
        party; and\par
\par
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from\par
        such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\par
        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\par
        software exchange.\par
\par
When the Program is made available in source code form:\par
\par
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\par
\par
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\par
    the Program.  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright\par
    notices contained within the Program.\par
\par
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\par
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\par
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\par
\par
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\par
\par
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\par
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\par
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\par
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\par
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\par
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a\par
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")\par
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor\par
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs\par
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\par
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to\par
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor\par
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\par
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any\par
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\par
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\par
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\par
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\par
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\par
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\par
claim at its own expense.\par
\par
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\par
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\par
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,\par
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and\par
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under\par
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims\par
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and\par
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any\par
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\par
\par
5. NO WARRANTY\par
\par
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\par
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\par
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\par
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A\par
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining\par
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\par
all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement\par
, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\par
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or\par
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\par
\par
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\par
\par
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\par
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\par
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\par
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\par
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\par
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION\par
OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF\par
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
7. GENERAL\par
\par
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\par
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\par
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\par
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\par
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\par
\par
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including\par
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\par
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\par
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\par
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\par
litigation is filed.\par
\par
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\par
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\par
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\par
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\par
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\par
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's\par
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\par
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\par
\par
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\par
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\par
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\par
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\par
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right\par
to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement\par
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve\par
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version\par
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The\par
Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to\par
the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,\par
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect\par
to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new\par
version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,\par
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of\par
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\par
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\par
under this Agreement are reserved.\par
\par
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\par
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to\par
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than\par
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights\par
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\par
