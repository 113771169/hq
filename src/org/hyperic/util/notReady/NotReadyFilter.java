/** 
 * A simple filter that will return 503 ( Service unavailable ) until the 
 * setReady(true) is called.
 * 
 * It can be used by HQ or any other app to reject requests until all 
 * initialization is completed.
 * 
 * To use it, just insert it in the web.xml, and map all the URIs of interest 
 * through this filter. 
 * 
 * When all subsystems are initialized and started, call setReady().
 * 
 * Another option is to use the AuthenticationFilter ( for the HQ UI ) and 
 * the AgentCallbackBossImpl ( for agent callbacks ). 
 * 
 * In any case - the critical step is figuring when all things are started 
 * correctly, and calling the method that will unlock the filter.
