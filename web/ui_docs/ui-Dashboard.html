				    <h3><a name="ui-Dashboard-HQDashboard"></a>HQ Dashboard</h3>

<p>The Hyperic HQ Dashboard is your starting point when you log in to Hyperic HQ. By default, it displays information about resource health, recent alerts, recently performed Auto-Discoveries, and control actions. You can also search for specific resources from the Dashboard, and display summary counts for all resources that Hyperic HQ is managing.</p>

<p>You can customize the Dashboard so that it displays only the information that matters to you when you first log in. Portlets can be removed from the Dashboard by clicking the <img src="ui-Dashboard_attachments/dash-icon_delete.png" align="absmiddle" border="0" /> icon on each portlet. Once a portlet is removed, it can be re-added from the Add content to this column: section at the bottom of the page. Portlets may also have configuration information which can be accessed using the <img src="ui-Dashboard_attachments/dash-icon_edit.png" align="absmiddle" border="0" /> icon on the top of each portlet. You can also re-arrange the portlets that are displayed by simply drag-and-dropping the header of each portlet, so that the information you are most concerned with will show up near the top of the page.</p>

<p>There are also a number of dashboard portlets that are capable of updating you through RSS.  Those portlets that support notifications through RSS display the <img src="ui-Dashboard_attachments/icon_feed.gif" align="absmiddle" border="0" /> icon.  Wherever you see this icon, you can click on or copy the link of the icon for the RSS feed URL.</p>
