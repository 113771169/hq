<p>In Hyperic, a <em>group</em> is an inventory type that is a collection of other inventory resources. This page describes the purpose of groups in Hyperic and different types of groups you can create.</p>

<h2><a name="AboutGroupsinHyperic-ResourceGroupsinHyperic"></a>Resource Groups in Hyperic </h2>

<p>In the Hyperic inventory model, a group is named set of other inventory resources. Grouping resources is useful for: </p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Monitoring a set of homogeneous or related resources in aggregate</b> - Groups enable role-specific monitoring views, or views that reflect the purpose or business need that the set of resources satisfy. In an environment with thousands of resources, viewing availability and performance data at the group level reduces the clutter in the user interface.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><b>Automating resource operations and control</b> &#8212; You can perform control actions on a group of like resources with a single command.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><b>Controlling access to resources</b> <font color="red">*</font> &#8212; Groups are fundamental to vFabric Hyperic's role-based access control. A Hyperic role specifies permissions to the resources in the groups associated with the role. Resources can only be associated with a role at the group level.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Note:</b> When you create a group in vFabric Hyperic, you can designate it as "private". Private groups are invisible to other users, including admin users. You can share a private group by associating it with a role. </p>

 

<h2><a name="AboutGroupsinHyperic-CompatibleGroups"></a>Compatible Groups </h2>

<p>A <em>compatible group</em> is a user-configured set of inventory items of the same type, for example "JBoss 4.x" servers, or "Linux" platforms.</p>

<p>Using compatible groups, you can ease the effort for operations tasks for a large population of like resources - you can perform the same control action on all members of a compatible group with a single command, on a scheduled or ad hoc basis. </p>

<p>Compatible groups enable richer monitoring. For instance, you can view metrics in aggregate across some or all resources of the same type. In vFabric Hyperic, you can set alerts on compatible groups. Group alerts fire based on the percentage or number of members that meet an alert condition. </p>

<p>The screenshot below is the <b>Monitor</b> tab for a compatible group. Note: </p>
<ul>
	<li>The <b>Indicators</b> panel charts the aggregate values for metrics across all group members.</li>
	<li>The <b>Resource</b> panel lists the member of the group, and the platforms that host group members.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The <b>Contro</b>l tab is present, because the selected group supports control actions.</li>
	<li>The <b>Alert</b> tab is present, because vFabric Hyperic supports alerts on compatible groups.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="AboutGroupsinHyperic-MixedGroups"></a>Mixed Groups </h2>

<p><em>Mixed groups</em> contain inventory resources that are of different types. </p>

<p>Mixed groups are useful in implementing access control policies - for instance, for a set of resources from the same vendor, or that are hosted for a particular customer. Mixed groups do not have a common measurement and control profile. The metrics available naturally vary for different types of resources for instance, you monitor free memory for a CPU, but not for a database table. For similar reasons, mixed groups do not support group control actions. </p>

<p>There are three basic sub-types of mixed groups, which vary in terms of their membership. When you browse mixed groups in Hyperic, the "Group Type" column shows each group's sub-type: </p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Mixed Group - Platforms, Servers, &amp; Service</em>. If your service level agreements vary by customer, you could use configure this sort of mixed group to contain all of the resources hosted for CustomerA, and name it accordingly. The "CustomerA" group might include multiple Linux platforms, each running Tomcat servers and a variety of deployed EJBs and servlets.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><em>Mixed Group - Groups.</em> This type of mixed group, a kind of "supergroup", is made up other groups. For example, a regional manager might use a mixed group that contains many customer-specific groups (like the "CustomerA" group above) to monitor availability and other metrics from a territory perspective.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><em>Mixed Group - Applications</em> &#45; This type of mixed group is made up of multiple applications. For example, a line-of-business manager might want to assess and monitor operations at the product line level.</li>
</ul>


<p>The following screenshot is the <b>Inventory</b> page for a mixed group.&nbsp; Note that no <b>Monitor</b> or <b>Control</b> or <b>Alert</b> tab is present, because these functions are not supported for a mixed group.</p>

<h2><a name="AboutGroupsinHyperic-Autogroups"></a>Autogroups </h2>

<p>An <em>autogroup</em> is a set of resources of the same type with the same parent resource. As the term implies, an autogroup is not explicitly configured. HQ automatically creates an autogroup to contain all of the resources of the same type on the same platform or server. An autogroup is named for the type of resources it contains. For instance, an autogroup that contains the CPUs on a platform is called "CPU".</p>

<h4><a name="AboutGroupsinHyperic-ViewaListofAutogroupsonaResource"></a>View a List of Autogroups on a Resource</h4>

<p>You can see the autogroups on a resource on its <b>Monitor</b> tab. This is the only way to see and navigate to an autogroup and its member resources. An autogroup name is only unique in the context of its parent resource.    </p>

<p>The name of the autogroup is prefixed with a blue folder-like icon <span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="attachments/66915257/67273161.gif" height="16" width="16" style="border: 0px solid black"/></span>. In the screenshot below, there are four autogroups in the "Platform Services" section: "CPU", "FileServer Mount", "HTTP", and "NetworkServer Interface". The Availability icon for an autogroup indicates the availability of the group. </p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="attachments/79038211/79135286.png" width="700" style="border: 0px solid black"/></span></p>

<h4><a name="AboutGroupsinHyperic-ViewMonitorTabforanAutogroup"></a>View Monitor Tab for an Autogroup</h4>

<p>When you click an autogroup in its parent's <b>Resources</b> panel, the <b>Monitor</b> tab for autogroup appears. The <b>Resources</b> panel lists the individual resources in the group, and indicator metrics are shown for the group as a whole. </p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="attachments/79038211/79135285.png" width="700" style="border: 0px solid black"/></span></p>

<h4><a name="AboutGroupsinHyperic-ViewMonitorTabforaMemberofanAutogroup"></a>View Monitor Tab for a Member of an Autogroup</h4>

<p>When you click an resource name in <b>Resources</b> panel for the parent autogroup, the <b>Monitor</b> tab for that resource appears, and indicator metrics are shown for that resource.  </p>
