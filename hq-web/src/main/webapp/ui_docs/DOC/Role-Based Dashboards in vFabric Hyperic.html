<h1><a name="Role-BasedDashboardsinvFabricHyperic-RoleBasedDashboards"></a>Role-Based Dashboards</h1>

<p>A role-based dashboard is a version of the HQ dashboard available to users assigned to the role. A role-based dashboard can be customized to match the needs and interests of users with that role. You can configure the contents of a role-based dashboard to meet the needs of users with that role.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A role-based dashboard is available in addition to a user's personal dashboard. Every vFabric Hyperic user has a personal dashboard, and a role-based dashboard for each role to which he is assigned. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Any modification to a role-based dashboard affects all users with the role; unlike a personal dashboard, a role-based dashboard cannot be customized on a per user basis.</p>

<h2><a name="Role-BasedDashboardsinvFabricHyperic-RoleBasedDashboardsareAutomaticallyAvailable"></a>Role-Based Dashboards are Automatically Available</h2>

<p>Upon creation of a new role, a copy of the standard vFabric Hyperic dashboard is saved and available to members of the role.&nbsp; Any HQ user with this role can navigate to it using the <b>Select a Dashboard</b> pull-down, and designate it as his default dashboard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The default dashboard for a new user is his personal dashboard. To set a role-based dashboard to be the default, a user must select select it and click <b>Make Default.</b></p>

<h2><a name="Role-BasedDashboardsinvFabricHyperic-PermissionsforModifyingRoleBasedDashboards"></a>Permissions for Modifying Role-Based Dashboards</h2>

<p>A role-based dashboard can be modified by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>an HQ administrator with the Super User role</li>
	<li>an HQ user assigned to the role, if the role grants the "Modify" permission for "Roles".</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="Role-BasedDashboardsinvFabricHyperic-TailoraRoleBasedDashboard"></a>Tailor a Role-Based Dashboard</h2>

<p>To tailor the layout and content of a role-based dashboard:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the role-based dashboard from the <b>Select a Dashboard</b> pull-down on the currently displayed dashboard.</li>
	<li>Add, configure, remove, and rearrange the portlets in the dashboard, as desired. <a href="ui-Dashboard.html#ui-Dashboard-Tasks">Instructions</a> are available on the dashboard help page.</li>
</ol>


<p>Modifications to a role-based dashboard are immediate, and will appear any time a user with that role accesses it. </p>
