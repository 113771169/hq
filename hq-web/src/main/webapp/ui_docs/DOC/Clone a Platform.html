<h1><a name="CloneaPlatform-CloningaPlatform"></a>Cloning a Platform </h1>

<p>vFabric Hyperic's <b>Clone Platform</b> feature allows you to copy configuration properties for servers and manually created platform services from one platform to one or more other platforms.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Note:&nbsp;</b> Manually created platform services are the types of platform services that cannot be auto-discovered - typically the types you configure to proxy metrics for network services and devices, such as "HTTP", "POP3, or "DNS" services.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Platform cloning is supported between platforms of the same type (for example, "Linux") that run the same version of the Hyperic Agent. </p>

<h1><a name="CloneaPlatform-HowtoCloneaPlatform"></a>How to Clone a Platform </h1>

<p>The <b>Clone Platform</b> page is available on the <b>Tools</b> menu when a platform is selected. </p>
<ol>
	<li>Navigate to the platform whose inventory resources you wish to clone.</li>
	<li>Choose <b>Clone Platform</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>On the <b>Clone Platform</b> page, the "Available clone targets" list shows platforms of the same type as the source platform. You can narrow the list by entering a string in the "Search resources" box.</li>
	<li>Move desired target platforms from the "Available clone targets" list to the "Selected clone targets" list.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Queue for Cloning</b>. Cloning occurs asynchronously. You can perform other functions in the user interface without waiting for the cloning process to complete.</li>
</ol>


<h1><a name="CloneaPlatform-WhatCloningisGoodFor"></a>What Cloning is Good For </h1>

<p>Platform cloning makes it easy to replicate configuration properties for resources of the same type.&nbsp; For instance, </p>
<ul>
	<li>You have a dozen Linux platforms, each running Tomcat 6.0, JBoss 4.2, and MySQL 5.0. The Hyperic Agent is installed on each platform, and has auto-discovered the Tomcat, JBoss, and MySQL instances on each platform.&nbsp; You want to implement an identical log tracking configuration for servers of the same type on each of platforms.&nbsp; You edit the "Configuration Properties" on the Inventory page for the Tomcat, JBoss, and MySQL instances on one of the platforms. You can use <b>Clone Platform</b> to copy the configuration settings to the Tomcat, JBoss, and MySQL instances on the other 11 platforms.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>You are setting up multiple platforms to monitor&nbsp;network services or devices. To enable network monitoring, on each platform you need a properly configured platform service to serve as a proxy for each remote service or device. You can configure the platform services on one platform, and use <b>Clone Platform</b> to create platform services with the same configuration properties on each of the&nbsp; other platforms.</li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="CloneaPlatform-WhatCloningDoes"></a>What Cloning Does </h1>

<p>The cloning process can create new resources on the target platform or update an existing resource's configuration properties. The cloning process: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Copies the configuration properties for each server on the source platform to corresponding servers of the same type on the target platforms. If there is not a corresponding server of the same type on a target platform, it is created, with the same configuration properties as the source server.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Copies the configuration properties for each manually created platform service on the source platform to the target platforms - adding a new platform service to the target platform's inventory, or updating configuration properties of corresponding instances in the target platform inventory.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Cloning occurs asynchronously, so you can perform other functions in the Hyperic user interface after initiating the process. The <b>Event Center</b> indicates the start and stop of the cloning process for the source platform.</li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="CloneaPlatform-WhatCloningDoesn%27tDo"></a>What Cloning Doesn't Do </h1>

<p>The cloning process: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Does not update auto-discovered properties</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Does not create or update auto-discovered platform services, such as CPUs or File Server Mounts</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Does not create or update services that comprise the cloned servers; the child services will be added to inventory on the target platform via auto-discovery.</li>
</ul>
