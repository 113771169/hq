<h1><a name="NetworkPlatformServices-HypericNetworkServiceMonitoringCapabilities"></a>Hyperic Network Service Monitoring Capabilities</h1>

<p>A Hyperic Agent can monitor a variety of remote services over the network. To enable monitoring of a service on the network, you configure a platform service on an operating system platform. The platform service you configure is a proxy for the remote service - in the HQ user interface, the remote service appears as a "child" of the platform whose agent monitors it. For information about how different sorts of managed resources map to a resource hierarchy in HQ, see <a href="Resources, Resource Types and Inventory Types.html" title="Resources, Resource Types and Inventory Types">Resources, Resource Types and Inventory Types</a>.</p>

<p>The screenshot below lists the platform services on a selected platform. The resources marked with an arrow are network services that have been configured as platform services on the platform. The network services on the plaform include multiple HTTP services, an IMAP service, an RPC service, and an SSH service. The resource named "HTTP" is an autogroup that represents all of the HTTP services configured on the platform. (HQ's autogrouping behavior is described in [<a href="Resources, Resource Types and Inventory Types.html" title="Resources, Resource Types and Inventory Types">Resources, Resource Types and Inventory Types</a>.) The other platform services in the list are local services (CPUs, FileServer Mounts, and NetworkServer Interfaces) that the agent auto-discovered.</p>

<p>The availability of each network service, and each autogroup of network services, is indicated by an icon:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Green - "Available", indicates that a service (or all of the services in an autogroup) is available.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Yellow - The "Warning" availability state does not apply to an individual network service, with few exceptions. Generally, the agent reports that a network service is either "Available" (green) or "Not Available" (red). The "Warning" state <em>is</em> reported for an autogroup of network services, and indicates that not all of the services in the group are available.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Red - "Not Available", indicates that the service (or all of the services in an autogroup) is not available.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Grey - "Unknown", indicates that availability cannot be determined, because the service was created, but not configured correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="NetworkPlatformServices-ConfigurationRequirementsandOptionsforMonitoringNetworkServices"></a>Configuration Requirements and Options for Monitoring Network Services</h1>

<p>Configuration requirements vary by the type of network service you wish to monitor. At a minimum you must configure the location of the network resource, and depending on the resource, you may also need to supply the credentials required to access it.</p>

<p>You can optionally configure event tracking for any type of network service that Hyperic monitors. If you do, the agent will log an event for responses that match the criteria you specify. You can define alert conditions based on events logged for remote service, just as you can for managed resources on the same platform as the agent.</p>

<h1><a name="NetworkPlatformServices-MetricsforNetworkServices"></a>Metrics for Network Services</h1>

<p>The metrics reported for a remote service varies by type.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Availability - The Hyperic Agent reports availability for any network service that it can can monitor. Availability is determined by various means, depending on the protocol used to communicate with the managed resource. This process typically consists of opening a socket, reading and writing from it, and closing it. For some services, this alone constitutes availability, for other services, availability is conditioned on response content, such as a response level or code. The type of request the agent issues to determine availability is protocol-dependent.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Response Time - Like availability, response time is reported for any network service that the Hyperic Agent can monitor. Response time for a network service reflects the length of time (in ms) that the agent takes to determine service availability.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Connection Metrics - For service types that are purely connection-based, connection state metrics, obtained using netstat, are typically available. Note that connection metrics are not enabled by default. To collect connection metrics for a network service, enable them on the <b>Monitoring Defaults</b> page for the service type.</li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="NetworkPlatformServices-ClassesforMonitoringaNetworkService"></a>Classes for Monitoring a Network Service</h1>

<p>Most network services are monitored by classes in Hyperic's netservices plugin. (Notable exception: if you monitor a remote SNMP agent, Hyperic's <tt>SNMPMeasurementPlugin</tt> performs most of the metric collection.)</p>
