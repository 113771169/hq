<p>This page describes the fundamental inventory types in Hyperic: <em>platforms</em>, <em>servers</em>, and <em>services</em> &#8212; any individual resource instances has one of these types.  For information about inventory types that are configurable collections of other resources &#8212; <em>groups</em> and <em>applications</em> &#8212; see <a href="About Groups in Hyperic.html" title="About Groups in Hyperic">About Groups in Hyperic</a> and <a href="About Applications in Hyperic.html" title="About Applications in Hyperic">About Applications in Hyperic</a>.</p>





<p><a name="AboutPlatforms%2CServers%2CandServices-platforms"></a></p>
<h2><a name="AboutPlatforms%2CServers%2CandServices-Platforms"></a>Platforms</h2>

<p>There are two major kinds of platforms in Hyperic.</p>

<h3><a name="AboutPlatforms%2CServers%2CandServices-OperatingSystemPlatforms"></a>Operating System Platforms</h3>

<p>An <em>operating system platform</em> is a computer and the operating system that runs on it. The Hyperic Agent auto-discovers operating system platform using Hyperic's <tt>system</tt> plugin. You cannot manually add an operating system platform to inventory.&nbsp;Hyperic supports these operating system platform types:</p>
<ul>
	<li>AIX</li>
	<li>FreeBSD</li>
	<li>HPUX</li>
	<li>Linux</li>
	<li>MacOSX</li>
	<li>Solaris</li>
	<li>Unix</li>
	<li>Win32</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="AboutPlatforms%2CServers%2CandServices-VirtualandNetworkPlatforms"></a>Virtual and Network Platforms</h3>
<p><a name="AboutPlatforms%2CServers%2CandServices-NetworkHostPlatforms"></a>Hyperic supports a variety of platform types that do not map to an individual physical machine running a traditional operating system. These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Resources that a Hyperic Agent monitors remotely over the network, such as for network hosts and devices,</li>
	<li>Virtual resources such as VMware vSphere hosts and VMs, and</li>
	<li>Distributed sets of resources, such as GemFire Distributed Systems.</li>
</ul>


<p>The Hyperic Agent does not automatically discover and monitor virtual and network platforms &#8212; typically you create such platforms manually (using the <b>New Platform</b> command on the <b>Tools</b> menu in the <b>Resource</b> tab of the Hyperic user interface), or at a minimum, supply resource properties data that enable the agent to manage them. These are the virtual and network platform types that Hyperic supports:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cisco IOS</li>
	<li>Cisco Pixos</li>
	<li>GemFire Distributed System</li>
	<li>NetApp Filer</li>
	<li>Network Device</li>
	<li>Network Host</li>
	<li>VMware vSphere Host</li>
	<li>VMware vSphere VM</li>
	<li>Xen Host</li>
</ul>


<p>For information about creating an un-discoverable platform, see <a href="Create a Platform.html" title="Create a Platform">Create a Platform</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="AboutPlatforms%2CServers%2CandServices-Servers"></a>Servers</h2>

<p>In Hyperic, a server is software product that runs on a platform. Servers provide a communications interface and perform specific tasks upon request. Examples of server types include Tomcat, JBoss, and Exchange. The <b>Monitoring Defaults</b> page in Hyperic's <b>Administration</b> tab lists all of the server types that Hyperic supports.</p>

<p>Most server types are auto-discovered by a server type-specific Hyperic plugin. If the plugin that manages a server does not support auto-discovery, or if auto-discover of a server fails, you may need to manually create a server, as described in <a href="Create a Server.html" title="Create a Server">Create a Server</a>.</p>

<p>The screenshot below shows the <b>Monitor</b> tab for a server. The <b>Resources</b> panel for the server lists its child services and parent platform.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="AboutPlatforms%2CServers%2CandServices-ServicesandPlatformServices"></a>Services and Platform Services</h2>

<p>In Hyperic, a service is a software component dedicated to a particular task that runs on a server or platform. A service that runs on a server is referred to as a <em>service</em>. A service that runs on a platform is referred to as a <em>platform service</em>.</p>

<p>The resource plugin that discovers a platform or server also discovers key services &#8212; such as CPUs, network interfaces, file systems, and so on &#8212; running on the platform.  </p>

<p>In addition, an authorized user can explicitly configure a platform service on a platform to serve as a proxy for a resource the Hyperic Agent can monitor over the network, for example, a DNS or POP3 service.  For more information see <a href="Create a Platform Service.html" title="Create a Platform Service">Create a Platform Service</a></p>

<p>Services that runs on a server can be either an internal component of the server (for instance, "Weblogic Admin 9.2 Entity EJB service") or a deployed item ("CustomerEntityEJB").</p>

<p>The <b>Monitoring Defaults</b> page in Hyperic's <b>Administration</b> tab lists the service and platform service types that Hyperic supports.</p>

<p>The screenshot below shows the <b>Monitor</b> tab for a service. The <b>Resources</b> panel for the service lists its parent server.</p>
