				    <p>Resources in the Hyperic Inventory are hierarchically related. A resource is classified as an inventory type (platform, server, service, group, or application) and as a resource type that identifies the brand of the inventory type (a Win32 platform, a JBoss 4.0 server, and so forth).</p>

</ul>





<h1><a name="ResourcesandResourceCategoriesinHyperic-InventoryType"></a>Inventory Type</h1>

<p>A resource's <em>inventory type</em> is the first level of classification that Hyperic applies to resources. Inventory types serve two purposes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Resource hierarchy. Several inventory types identify where a resource fits into a resource hierarchy. All Hyperic resources are classified as one of the following inventory types.
	<ul>
		<li>platform - usually corresponds to a machine running an operating system</li>
		<li>server - a software product running on an operating system, for instance a database or application server</li>
		<li>service - an integral component of a platform or server, for instance, a file server mount, database table, or a connection pool.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Grouped resources. There are two inventory types that correspond to multiple individual resources.&nbsp; You group resources for a variety of reasons:&nbsp; to monitor a set of like or related resources in aggregate; to administer or control like resources at the group level instead of individually; and, in vFabric Hyperic, for resource access control. There are two inventory types that are named sets of other resources:
	<ul>
		<li>group</li>
		<li>application</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<p>In summary, "inventory type" classifies a resource as a platform, server, service, group, or application. The term "inventory level" refers to inventory types that fit into a hierarchical structure - platforms, servers, and services.</p>

<h1><a name="ResourcesandResourceCategoriesinHyperic-ResourceType"></a>Resource Type</h1>

<p>Each individual resource (every resource that is a platform, server, or service) in Hyperic inventory has a <em>resource type</em>&nbsp; that indicates what kind of platform, server, or service it is.&nbsp; For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>The resource type of a Windows system (whose inventory type is "platform") is "Win32";&nbsp; the resource type of a Linux system (whose inventory type is also platform) is "Linux".&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>For clarity, Hyperic documentation refers to resource types that correspond to platforms - like "Win32" and "Linux" - as <em>platform types</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>The resource type of&nbsp; a JBoss 4.0 instance (whose inventory type is "server") is "JBoss 4.0"; the resource type of a WebLogic 9.1 instance (whose inventory type is also server) is "WebLogic 9.1".&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>For clarity, Hyperic documentation refers to resource types that correspond to servers - such as "JBoss 4.0" and "WebLogic 9.1" - as <em>server types</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>The resource type of a Jboss entity EJB (whose inventory type is "service") is "JBoss 4.0 Entity EJB"; the resource type of a WebLogic&nbsp; EJB (whose inventory type is also service) is "WebLogic 9.2 Entity EJB".
	<ul>
		<li>For clarity, Hyperic documentation refers to resource types that correspond to services - such as "JBoss 4.0 Entity EJB" and "WebLogic 9.1 Entity EJB" - as <em>service types</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<p>In summary, "resource type" classifies a resource as a particular type of platform, server, service.</p>


<h1><a name="ResourcesandResourceCategoriesinHyperic-PlatformServerServiceHierarchy"></a>Platform Server Service Hierarchy</h1>

<p>In Hyperic, platforms, servers, and servers are hierarchically related.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A platform is usually a machine its operating system, with a Hyperic Agent running on it. There are also platform types for virtual and network hosts.</li>
	<li>A server is a software product that runs on a platform.</li>
	<li>A service is an resource that is integral to, or runs upon, a platform or server.&nbsp; Whether the resource is at the platform or server level, in Hyperic it is a  "service".  Note, however that services associated with a platform are usually referred to as a <em>platform service</em>s.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hyperic auto-discovers most platform, server, and service types and populates the Hyperic database with key information about each discovered item, and its relationship with other resources.</p>

<h2><a name="ResourcesandResourceCategoriesinHyperic-GraphicalViewofaResourceHierarchy"></a>Graphical View of a Resource Hierarchy</h2>

<p>The diagram below illustrates a specific platform-server-service hierarchy. (Only a subset of the servers and services in the hierarchy are shown.) The label for each resource indicates its type. The hierarchy consists of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a platform of whose type is "MacOSX"</li>
	<li>two platform services, whose types are "File System" and "CPU"</li>
	<li>two servers, whose types are "JBoss 4.2" and "Tomcat 6.0"</li>
	<li>four services (that run in servers) whose types are "JMS Topic", "JMS Destination", "Webapp", and "Connector".</li>
</ul>

<p>The screenshot below is the <b>Monitor</b> tab for the platform whose hierarchy is partially illustrated in the previous section. Note that the <b>Resources</b> panel shows the currently selected resource's immediate "relatives". For the selected platform, the <b>Resources</b> panel lists the platform services and the servers that run on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
