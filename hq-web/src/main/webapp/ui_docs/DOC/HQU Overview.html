<h1><a name="HQUOverview-WhatisHQU%3F"></a><b>What is HQU?</b></h1>
<p>HQU is a framework within HQ for creating and deploying extensions to HQ.  It provides tools and APIs for extending the HQ Portal, integrating HQ with other systems, and automating HQ administrative tasks.  The HQU framework is based on Groovy, a scripting language with syntax similar to Java. Groovy runs in the JVM and can interact with regular Java classes and libraries.  </p>
<h1><a name="HQUOverview-WhatisHQUGoodFor%3F"></a><b>What is HQU Good For?</b></h1>
<p>HQU helps you tailor HQ to your environment and work flows. You can use it to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Extend the HQ Portal—HQU Plugins can add Views to the HQ user interface.  HQU has been used to develop some of the regular HQ Portal pages. Examples include the Alert Center, a single page view of triggered alerts across an HQ deployment; the Event Center, a filterable view of HQ events such as log entries, configuration changes, and Alerts; and the Systems Down page.</li>
	<li>Automate  HQ functions—HQU plugins can automate HQ functions that you perform frequently or in high volume. For example, the HQU Mass plugin allows you to list or approve multiple Platforms in the auto-discovery queue, using regular expressions.</li>
	<li>Integrate HQ with other systems—HQU plugins can expose Web services for exchanging data with other systems.  For example, the HQU OpenNMS plugin enables export of Platform and Alert data from HQ to OpenNMS. HQU Web services plugins can use the XML or the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) interchange format, useful if the consumer of the web services is a browser.</li>
</ul>


<p>Other HQU plugins that ship with HQU include the  the Groovy Console, HQ Health page, and LiveExec Views.</p>
<h1><a name="HQUOverview-HQUPluginsandtheHQUI"></a><b>HQU Plugins and the HQ UI</b></h1>
<p>As desired, an HQU plugin can be made available from several locations in the HQ Portal:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The View tab for a Resource</li>
	<li>As items on the Resources and Analyze menus</li>
	<li>In the Plugins section of the Administration page</li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="HQUOverview-OverviewofHQUPluginDevelopment"></a><b>Overview of HQU Plugin Development</b>  </h1>
<p>Creating an HQU plugin involves these basic steps.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Generate the plugin files. HQU provides a scaffold tool that creates a plugin directory structure with the files required for a functional plugin.</li>
	<li>Program the core plugin functionality. HQU provides helper APIs for accessing HQ data and functions. You can use the Groovy Console in the HQ Portal to execute Groovy code and HQ methods within the context of the HQ Server.</li>
	<li>Plug it in. If your plugin is designed to render content to a browser, you integrate it into the HQU Portal user interface by specifying its attachment point.</li>
	<li>Deploy the plugin. Add the plugin to the HQ Portal web application (HQ.war); it will be automatically hot-deployed. You can use the HQU plugin manager for debugging and for removing plugin Views from HQ Portal pages.</li>
</ol>
