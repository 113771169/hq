				    <h3><a name="ui-Alert.Condition-DefineAlertCondition"></a>Define Alert Condition</h3>

<p>An alert condition specifies a resource metric value or event that will initiate the alert firing process.</p>

<p>The condition types you can choose in the alert definition page vary by resource type and HQ version. If a condition type is not supported by your version of HQ or is not valid for the target resource, it will not appear as an option.</p>

<p>To define the alert condition, choose one of the following condition types, and select or enter the required parameter values.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Metric condition</b> &#45;&nbsp; Use this condition type to base the alert on the value of a metric that HQ collects for the resource. To create a metric condition:
	<ol>
		<li>Select a metric from the selector list.&nbsp; Only currently enabled metrics are listed.&nbsp; (If the metric you're looking for is not listed, see the note below.)</li>
		<li>Define the rule for evaluating the metric value.&nbsp; Choose one of the following options:
		<ul>
			<li>Metric value is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to the value you specify.</li>
			<li>Any change in metric value.</li>
			<li>In HQ Enterprise only:
			<ul>
				<li>Metric value is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to a percentage (specified as a decimal value less than 1) of the baseline value for the metric.&nbsp; Requires that baselining feature is enabled.&nbsp; For more information, see <a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Baselines" title="Baselines">Baselines</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ul>


<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><b>To Enable Collection of a Metric</b></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>If you want to base a metric condition on a metric that is not currently collected, you have to enable collection of that metric. To do so, update the metric collection settings for the resource type (choose <b>Monitoring Defaults</b> from the <b>Administration</b> tab), or for the specific resource (click <b>Metrics</b> on the <b>Monitor</b> tab for the resource).</p>
</div></div>
<ul>
	<li><b>Inventory Property Condition</b> &#45; To define a condition that is triggered when the value of an inventory property for resource changes, select an inventory property.&nbsp; The pulldown contains only those inventory properties that are valid for the type of the resource to which the alert applies.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><b>Control Action Condition</b> &#45; When you define an alert for a resource that supports control actions, you can define a condition that is triggered when a particular control action is performed. If desired, you can base the condition on a control action with a particular result status: "in progress", "completed", or "failed".&nbsp; Pulldowns allow you to select a control action that the resource supports, and a result status if desired.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><b>Events/Log Level Condition</b> &#45; To define a condition that is triggered by a log event, select a message severity level ("error", "warn", "info", "debug", "all") and optionally a match string. The condition is satisfied each time a message of the selected severity that contains the match string (if one was specified) is written to a log file that HQ is tracking. Log tracking must be enabled for the resource. To determine the log files that HQ monitors for the resource, see the <b>Configuration Properties</b> section of the resource's <b>Inventory</b> tab. The log files that HQ monitors for a resource are defined using the <b>server.log_track.files</b> property. For configuration instructions, see&nbsp; see <a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Log+Tracking" title="Log Tracking">Log Tracking</a>.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><b>Config Changed... Condition</b> &#45; This type of condition is triggered by a change to a configuration file that HQ is configured to monitor for the resource. To limit the condition to a single file, enter its filename in the "match filename" field.&nbsp; If you don't specify a filename, a change to any file monitored will trigger the alert.&nbsp; To determine the log files that HQ monitors for the resource, see the <b>Configuration Properties</b> section of the resource's <b>Inventory</b> tab. The files that HQ monitors for a resource are defined using the <b>server.config_track.files</b> property. The maximum length for filename entered is&nbsp; 25 characters.&nbsp; For configuration instructions, see <a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Configuration+Tracking" title="Configuration Tracking">Configuration Tracking</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="ui-Alert.Condition-DefineAdditionalConditions"></a>Define Additional Conditions<font color="red">&#42;</font></h3>

<p>In HQ Enterprise, you can define up to three conditions for an alert. To add another condition, click <b>Add Another Condition</b> and specify whether both the new condition and the preceding one must be satisfied for the alert to be triggered ("AND") or only one must be satisfied ("OR").</p>

<h3><a name="ui-Alert.Condition-DefineRecoveryAlertBehavior"></a>Define Recovery Alert Behavior<font color="red">&#42;</font></h3>

<p>To designate the alert you're defining as a recovery alert, select the primary alert definition from the pulldown. A recovery alert condition should detect when the condition that fired the primary alert is no longer true. When a recovery alert fires, it marks the primary alert "Fixed", and re-enables the primary alert definition. A recovery alert should be paired with a primary alert definition that is configured with the <b>Disable alert until marked fixed or by recovery alert</b> action, as described below in <a href="#ui-Alert.Condition-EnableActionFilters">Enable Action Filters</a>. For more information, see <a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Recovery+Alerts" title="Recovery Alerts">Recovery Alerts</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="ui-Alert.Condition-EnableActions"></a>Enable Actions<font color="red">&#42;</font></h3>

<p>In HQ Enterprise, you can use the <em>"Once every x times conditions are met within a time period of y minutes</em>" option to configure an alert definition to fire when its conditions occur multiple times in a time period, instead of every time the condition are met. Enter a period of time, and how many occurrences of the conditions within the period are required to fire the alert.</p>
<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><b>Option removed in 4.1</b></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>In versions of HQ Enterprise previous to 4.1, you could configure an alert definition to fire when its conditions have meet met continuously for a specified portion of an period of time.&nbsp; the option - <em>"When conditions are exceeded for</em> <em>x within a time period of y</em> <em>minutes"</em> &#45; was removed in HQ 4.1.</p>
</div></div>

<h3><a name="ui-Alert.Condition-EnableActionFilters"></a>Enable Action Filters</h3>

<p>If you select this option, when the alert fires it will disable the alert definition to prevent it from firing again until the alert is fixed. Use this option if you don't want repeated alerts fired for the same triggering event.&nbsp; In HQ Enterprise, configure this behavior if you intend to assign a recovery alert to the current alert definition.  For more information, see <a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Recovery+Alerts" title="Recovery Alerts">Recovery Alerts</a></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Disable alert until marked fixed or by recovery alert -</b> By default, an alert fires as soon as the condition or conditions are met, and fires again every time the conditions are re-evaluated and determined to be satisfied. If you choose this option, the alert definition will be disabled when an alert fires, and automatically re-enabled when the fired alert is marked "fixed", either manually or via a recovery alert.</li>
</ul>


<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><b>Option removed in 4.2</b></div><div class="panelContent">
<p>Versions of HQ previous to 4.2 also had a <b>Filter notification actions that are defined for related alerts</b> option to prevent multiple notification when alerts fire for resources on the same platform. In HQ 4.2, the option was removed. HQ 4.2 provides enhanced functionality for global control of notification volume.&nbsp; For more information, see <a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Controlling+Alert+and+Notification+Volume#ControllingAlertandNotificationVolume-SetaNotificationThrottle">Set a Notification Throttle</a>.</p>
