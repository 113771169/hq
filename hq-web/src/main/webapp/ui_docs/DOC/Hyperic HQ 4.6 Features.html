<h2><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-DocumentationPackagingandPublishing"></a>Documentation Packaging and Publishing</h2>

<p>The complete vFabric Hyperic documentation set is built in to Hyperic 4.6, and can be accessed by clicking help on any page in the Hyperic user interface. The Hyperic Server option to connect to the Hyperic support site (<a href="http://support.hyperic.com">http://support.hyperic.com</a>) for help content is removed from Hyperic 4.6. (In previous Hyperic releases, only help pages for the user interface were packaged in the product, and there was a configuration option on the <b>HQ Server Settings</b> page to toggle between product-internal help and help served from <a href="http://support.hyperic.com">http://support.hyperic.com</a>.)</p>

<p>Upon G.A. of VMware vFabric Platform 5.0, vFabric Hyperic 4.6 documentation, including downloadable PDFs, will also be available at  <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_4.6.html">http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_4.6.html</a>, where Hyperic documentation will be published henceforth. Documentation for vFabric 4.6 and later will not be maintained on the Hyperic support site.</p>

<h2><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-ProductPluginManagementandDeployment"></a>Product Plugin Management and Deployment </h2>

<p>Hyperic 4.6 provides new features that ease the process of deploying and managing product plugins. These features include a user interface for managing product plugins, and new Hyperic Server and Hyperic Agent behaviors for ensuring consistent plugin deployment across a Hyperic environment. </p>

<p>The new plugin management features are briefly described in the paragraphs below. For more detailed information, see "Plugin Deployment and Management" in <em>vFabric Hyperic Administration</em> at <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Administration.html">http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Administration.html</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-PluginManager"></a>Plugin Manager </h3>

<p><b>Plugin Manager</b> is a new user interface that enables you to deploy and manage plugins across a Hyperic deployment from the Hyperic user interface. You can use <b>Plugin Manager</b> to deploy and remove plugins on the Hyperic Server and all agents reporting to the server. </p>

<h3><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-ServerAgentPluginSynchronization"></a>Server-Agent Plugin Synchronization </h3>

<p>The new <em>Server-Agent Plugin Synchronization (SAPS)</em> feature ensures that product plugins are consistently deployed across a Hyperic deployment. SAPS is enabled by new behaviors on the Hyperic Server and Hyperic Agent. When a Hyperic 4.6 Agent starts up, it sends a plugin status report to the Hyperic Server. If an agent's deployed plugins do not exactly match those deployed on the Hyperic server, the server updates the agent's plugins appropriately. Similarly, each time the Hyperic Server is restarted, it compares the product plugins it deploys to most recent plugin status reported by each agent &#8212; if an agent's deployed plugins do not exactly match those deployed on the Hyperic server, the server updates the agent's plugins appropriately. SAPS is enabled by default; it can be disabled using the new <tt>server.pluginsync.enable</tt> server property, described in the next section. </p>

<h3><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-NewHypericServerPropertytoEnableandDisableSAPS"></a>New Hyperic Server Property to Enable and Disable SAPS </h3>

<p>Hyperic 4.6 provides a new Hyperic Server property, <tt>server.pluginsync.enable</tt>, which you can use to disable the SAPS feature described in the previous section. To disable SAPS, add <tt>server.pluginsync.enable=false</tt> to <tt>ServerHome/conf/hq-server.conf</tt>, and restart the Hyperic Server. </p>

<h3><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-RequiredPluginDescriptorElementtoSupportSAPS"></a>Required Plugin Descriptor Element to Support SAPS </h3>

<p>As of Hyperic 4.6, all product plugins must have a version. The version of a plugin must be specified in a <tt>&lt;property&gt;</tt> element in the root <tt>&lt;plugin&gt;</tt> element in the XML descriptor for a product plugin. For more information, see <em>vFabric Hyperic Product Plug-in Development</em> at  <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Product_Plug-in_Development.html">http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Product_Plug-in_Development.html</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-SecurityChanges"></a>Security Changes</h2>

<p>The paragraphs below briefly summaries new and changed security features in Hyperic 4.6. For more detailed information, see "Hyperic Security Features and Recommendations" in <em>vFabric Hyperic Installation and Configuration</em> at <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Installation_and_Configuration.html">http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Installation_and_Configuration.html</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-Keystores"></a>Keystores</h3>

<p>If you use SSL for agent-to-server communication, you can use trusted SSL certificates from a certificate authority, or a self-signed certificate generated by Hyperic. <b>Hyperic recommends you configure user-managed keystores for the Hyperic 4.6 Server and Hyperic 4.6 Agents.</b>  Using unverified certificate reduces the security of the Hyperic environment.</p>

<p>For a more secure environment, run only Hyperic 4.6 Agents with a Hyperic 4.6 Server. </p>


<h4><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-ServerKeystore"></a>Server Keystore</h4>

<p>In Hyperic 4.6, for a <tt>-full</tt> installation, the installer prompts for whether you want to configure Hyperic Server for a user-managed keystore. </p>

<p>If you respond "yes", the installer prompts you to supply the path to the keystore and its password. </p>

<p>If you respond "no", the installer creates a keystore for the server, with a self-signed certificate. </p>

<p>For an <tt>-upgrade</tt> installation, the installer does <em>not</em> prompt for whether you want to configure Hyperic Server for a user-managed keystore. For compatibility with pre-4.6 Hyperic Agents, the installer automatically creates a keystore and self-signed certificate for the server.  </p>

<p>The properties that configure location and password for a user-managed keystore on the server are <tt>server.keystore.path</tt> and <tt>server.keystore.password</tt> in <tt>ServerHome/conf/hq-server.conf</tt> </p>

<h4><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-AgentKeystore"></a>Agent Keystore</h4>

<p>By default, a Hyperic 4.6 Agent creates its own keystore with a self-signed certificate the first time it starts up. To configure the agent for a user-managed keystore, you must specify the path and password of that keystore in the <tt>agent.properties</tt> file.</p>

<p>The properties that configure the location and password for a user-managed keystore on the agent are <tt>agent.keystore.path</tt> and <tt>agent.keystore.password</tt> in <tt>AgentHome/conf/agent.properties</tt> </p>

<h4><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-CertificateValidation"></a>Certificate Validation</h4>

<p>If the server presents an unverified certificate to a 4.6 agent, the agent warns that the authenticity of the Hyperic Server host cannot be established. It prompts for confirmation that you want to connect and import that certificate.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a 4.6 agent presents an unverified certificate to the 4.6 server, the server issues a warning, and prompts for confirmation to continue.</p>

<h4><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-UpgradeConsiderations"></a>Upgrade Considerations</h4>

<p>Instructions for upgrading the Hyperic Server and all Hyperic Agents to 4.6 are provided on "Hyperic 4.6 Upgrade Processes and Options" in <em>vFabric Hyperic Installation and Configuration</em> at <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Installation_and_Configuration.html">http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Installation_and_Configuration.html</a>.</p>

<p>Note that if you use Hyperic Product plugins that communicate with managed servers over SSL, it may be necessary to import the managed server's SSL certificate into the Hyperic Agent's keystore. For more information, about SSL and Hyperic product plugins, see "Hyperic Security Features and Recommendations" in <em>vFabric Hyperic Installation and Configuration</em> at <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Installation_and_Configuration.html">http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Installation_and_Configuration.html</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-iPadandiPhoneSupport"></a>iPad and iPhone Support </h2>

<p>You can access the Hyperic 4.6 user interface from iPads and iPhones.  </p>

<h2><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-UpdatedPlugins"></a>Updated Plugins </h2>

<p>All Hyperic plugins XML descriptors are updated to define the version of the plugin as a <tt>&lt;property&gt;</tt> element named "version".  </p>

<p>In addition, the following Hyperic plugins are updated with new functionality, or to support more recent versions of the managed product: </p>
<ul>
	<li>GemFire. Updated to support the security updates described above in <a href="#HypericHQ4.6Features-SecurityChanges">Security Changes</a>.</li>
	<li>RabbitMQ. No longer requires access the <tt>erlang.cookie</tt> file &#8212; the plugin now uses the <tt>rabbitmq-management</tt> plugin. The configuration process has changed, and additional metrics are available. For more information see "RabbitMQ" in <em>vFabric Hyperic Resource Configuration and Metrics</em> at <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Resource_Configuration_and_Metrics.html">http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Resource_Configuration_and_Metrics.html</a>. In addition, this plugin has been updated to support the security updates described above in <a href="#HypericHQ4.6Features-SecurityChanges">Security Changes</a>.</li>
	<li>vSphere. Updated to support the security updates described above in <a href="#HypericHQ4.6Features-SecurityChanges">Security Changes</a>.</li>
	<li>tc Server. Support for tc Server 7.0 added.</li>
	<li>Jboss. Support for Jboss 5.1 and 6.0 added.</li>
	<li>PostgreSQL. Support for PostgreSQL 9.0 added.</li>
	<li>WebSphere. Improvements to enable better troubleshooting of auto-discovery issues.</li>
	<li>WebLogic Server Plugin. Enhanced to enable discovery of node managers and managed servers in a WebLogic domain without accessing the Administration Server for the domain. In previous releases, it was necessary to discover the Administration Server for a domain, and then configure that resource with WebLogic Server credentials, in order to discover the node manager and managed servers in the domain.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="HypericHQ4.6Features-HQApiUpdates"></a>HQApi Updates</h2>
<p>Hyperic 4.6 includes HQApi 5.0. Changes include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><tt>client.properties</tt> &#8212; Supports encrypted passwords, and can be stored in either <tt>~/.hq</tt> or <tt>hqapi1-client-n.n.n/conf</tt>. In previous versions, the APIs look for server connection properties in  <tt>&#126;/.hq/client.properties</tt>; to use a connection properties in a different location you had to supply the path to the <tt>client.properties</tt> on the command line, using the <tt>--properties</tt> command qualifier. (Supplying the properties file location on the command line is still supported.) For more information about specifying connection properties in a file, see "HQApi Command-Line Tools" in <em>vFabric Hyperic Web Services API</em> at  <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Web_Services_API.html">http://pubs.vmware.com/vfabric5/topic/com.vmware.vfabric.hyperic.4.6/vFabric_Hyperic_Web_Services_API.html</a>.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><b>groovyshell</b> &#8212; New API that allows you to run Groovy scripts from the command shell.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><b>maintenance</b> &#8212; Updated to enable maintenance downtime to be scheduled for individual resources. In previous releases, maintenance could only be scheduled for a group of resources.</li>
</ul>
