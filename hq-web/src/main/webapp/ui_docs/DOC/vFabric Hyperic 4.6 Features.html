				    <h2><a name="vFabricHyperic4.6Features-EnhancedLDAPSupport"></a>Enhanced LDAP Support </h2>

<p>In vFabric Hyperic 4.6, a Hyperic user can be automatically assigned to Hyperic roles based on groups the user is assinged to in your LDAP system. If your LDAP groups correspond well &#8212; in terms of membership &#8212; to the roles you will set up in Hyperic, you can use this feature to automate the process of assigning Hyperic roles to a new user. </p>

<p>Given an an LDAP group whose membership is identical to the users you want to assign to a particular Hyperic role, you create a Hyperic role with the same name as the LDAP group. </p>

<p>The first time a user logs on to Hyperic with his LDAP credentials, the user is authenticated via the LDAP system, and register as a Hyperic user. If the LDAP user belongs to any LDAP groups whose names match existing Hyperic roles, those roles are assigned to the new Hyperic user account. </p>

<p>To enable this behavior: </p>

<ul>
	<li>When you configure Hyperic Server to use your LDAP system for authentication, you specify the LDAP group search base and associated filter criteria.</li>
	<li>You create roles with names that match the name of corresponding LDAP groups. role in Hyperic for each LDAP group.</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that subsequent changes to the LDAP user's group membership are not reflected in the associated Hyperic user's role assignments. </p>

<h2><a name="vFabricHyperic4.6Features-ScheduleMaintenanceDowntimeforaResource"></a>Schedule Maintenance Downtime for a Resource </h2>

<p>In vFabric Hyperic 4.6, you can scheduled downtime for an individual resource. In previous releases, downtime could only be scheduled for a resource group. The <b>Schedule Downtime</b> command is available on the <b>Tools</b> menu for a platform, server, service, or group. </p>


<h2><a name="vFabricHyperic4.6Features-ProductPluginforSpringInsightOperations"></a>Product Plugin for Spring Insight Operations </h2>

<p>Spring Insight is a web application that runs in tcServer Developer Edition and analyzes the runtime performance of applications running in the container and provides visibility into it activity on a request-by-request basis. Spring Insight Operations ships as a template with tcServer.</p>

<p>vFabric Hyperic 4.6's Spring Insight plugin collects application metrics from Spring Insight Operations. The plugin provides a user interface that correlates the performance of an application with the performance of the application server in runs in, and also with the platform that hosts the application server. Given a performance problem that appears to be at the application level, you can jump from the Hyperic Insight Applications view into the Insight Operations Dashboard, into the same application context as the problem occurred, to diagnose the underlying problem. </p>

<p>For plugin documentation, see <a href="Spring Insight.html" title="Spring Insight">Spring Insight</a>. For information about the Spring Insight view in the Hyperic user interface, see the <a href="ui-SpringInsight.html" title="ui-SpringInsight">help page</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="vFabricHyperic4.6Features-NewLicensingScheme"></a>New Licensing Scheme</h2>
<p><a name="vFabricHyperic4.6Features-licensing"></a><br/>
vFabric Hyperic 4.6 is available as a component of vFabric Platform 5, in addition to as a stand-alone product.  The Hyperic licensing scheme is changed in Hyperic 4.6 to support vFabric Platform 5's network licensing, as well as use of a local license for stand-alone vFabric Hyperic deployments.  </p>

<p>From the perspective a user performing an Hyperic installation, the key differences are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You not longer install a <tt>license.xml</tt> file into <tt>&lt;ServerHome/conf</tt>.  Instead:
	<ul>
		<li>For a standalone Hyperic 4.6 deployment, you install a serial number file in <tt>&lt;ServerHome/conf</tt>.</li>
		<li>For a vFabric Platform deployment of Hyperic 4.6 you either:
		<ul>
			<li>Install a serial number file in <tt>&lt;ServerHome/conf</tt>, or</li>
			<li>Configure the location of the VMware License Server that administers the network license for vFabric Platform. If Hyperic Server is running on a physical machine, rather than a VM managed by VMware vCenter, you must use this option.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
