				    <h2><a name="vFabricHyperic4.6Features-EnhancedLDAPSupport"></a>Enhanced LDAP Support </h2>

<p>In vFabric Hyperic 4.6, a Hyperic user can be automatically assigned to Hyperic roles based on groups to which the user is assigned in your LDAP system. If your LDAP groups correspond well in terms of membership to the roles you will set up in Hyperic, you can use this feature to automate the process of assigning Hyperic roles to a new user. </p>

<p>Given an LDAP group whose membership is identical to the users you want to assign to a particular Hyperic role, you create a Hyperic role with the same name as the LDAP group. </p>

<p>The first time a user logs on to Hyperic with LDAP credentials, the user is authenticated through the LDAP system, and registered as a Hyperic user. If the LDAP user belongs to any LDAP groups whose names match existing Hyperic roles, those roles are assigned to the new Hyperic user account. </p>

<p>To enable this behavior: </p>

<ul>
	<li>When you configure Hyperic Server to use your LDAP system for authentication, you specify the LDAP group search base and associated filter criteria.</li>
	<li>You create roles with names that match the name of corresponding LDAP groups.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Note:</b> Subsequent changes to the LDAP user's group membership are not reflected in the associated Hyperic user's role assignments. </p>

<h2><a name="vFabricHyperic4.6Features-ScheduleMaintenanceDowntimeforaResource"></a>Schedule Maintenance Downtime for a Resource </h2>

<p>In vFabric Hyperic 4.6, you can schedule downtime for an individual resource. In previous releases, downtime could be scheduled only for a resource group. The <b>Schedule Downtime</b> command is available on the <b>Tools</b> menu for a platform, server, service, or group. </p>


<h2><a name="vFabricHyperic4.6Features-ProductPluginforSpringInsightOperations"></a>Product Plugin for Spring Insight Operations </h2>

<p>Spring Insight is a Web application that runs in tc Server Developer Edition and analyzes the runtime performance of applications running in the container. Spring Insight provides visibility into application performance on a request-by-request basis. Spring Insight Operations is available as two templates (server and agent) with vFabric tc Server Spring Edition.</p>

<p>The vFabric Hyperic 4.6 Spring Insight plugin collects application metrics from Spring Insight Operations. The plugin provides a user interface that correlates the performance of an application with the performance of the application server it runs in, and also with the platform that hosts the application server. Given a performance problem that appears to be at the application level, you can jump from the Hyperic Insight Applications view to the Insight Operations Dashboard, into the same application context as the problem occurred, to diagnose the underlying problem. </p>


<h2><a name="vFabricHyperic4.6Features-NewLicensingScheme"></a>New Licensing Scheme</h2>
<p><a name="vFabricHyperic4.6Features-licensing"></a><br/>
vFabric Hyperic 4.6 is available as a component of vFabric Cloud Application Platform 5.0 (vFabric Platform) and as a standalone product. The Hyperic licensing scheme is changed in Hyperic 4.6 to support vFabric Platform 5's platform-level license management.</p>

<p>You no longer install a <tt>license.xml</tt> file into <tt>ServerHome/conf</tt>.  Instead, o activate your license: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a file named <tt>vf.hyp-serial-numbers.txt</tt> that contains the product serial number provided by VMware. Install the serial number file in:
	<ul>
		<li><tt>/etc/opt/vmware/vfabric/</tt> on Unix-like platforms</li>
		<li><tt>%ALLUSERPROFILE%\vmware\vfabric</tt> on Windows platforms.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you obtained vFabric Hyperic as a part of vFabric Platform, configure the location of the VMware License Server that administers the network license for vFabric Platform, by adding the <tt>vfabric.licenseServer.url</tt> property to <tt>ServerHome/conf/hq-server.conf</tt>.</li>
	<li>Restart the Hyperic Server.</li>
</ol>


<p>You can view your license terms on the <b>HQ License Details</b> section of the <b>Administration</b> tab in the Hyperic user interface.</p>
