    Congratulations!  You've reached your plugin, @PLUGIN_NAME@
  </p>
  <p>
    You should rename your controller from 
    <b>@NEW_PLUGIN_PATH@/app/SampleController.groovy</b> to
    something cooler, like <b>ConsoleController.groovy</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll also want to change init.groovy at <b>@NEW_PLUGIN_PATH@</b> to use
    a better description.
